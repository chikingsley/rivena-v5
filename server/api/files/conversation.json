Maybe in the evening we will go to flamenco, but I will most likely be able to pick up my things on Sunday. \nIf it is ok. \n\nI kinda miss you\n(\ud83d\udc4d 1)\nRegina: Thank you\nRegina: Hey party animal and nerd.\n\n I want to talk to your clone but I only watched 3 minutes so I don't know how it works yet. \n\nI spend 100% of my time with my sister and we fight all the time lol. She's definitely teaching me patience \ud83d\ude05\nRegina: Hey,\n\nI want to take some stuff in the evening if it's okay \ud83d\ude42\n(\ud83d\udc4d 1)\nRegina: You're in the office, right? I want to come if you have time to share updates, I am curious. \nStaying in the Phrom Phong area now\n\nBut if you're busy, it's okay\nSimon Jackson: Yes here but don\u2019t want to talk\nRegina: Got it, enjoy your time \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\nSimon Jackson: Never\nRegina: Never what?\nSimon Jackson: Anything\nRegina: Never enjoying your time?\nSimon Jackson: Can\u2019t respond\nRegina: You are doing great learning new things and following your own path. That's enough\nRegina: Wanted to share some info but sometimes I don't know how.. when you are busy\nSimon Jackson: what info\nSimon Jackson: I see everything\nRegina: 1. I am also dealing with AI. But it's Annoying Irritation \ud83d\ude25 so I am taking antibiotics. And we should be more serious about having sex without a condom. \n\n2. The honey I brought is famous in Russia. If you don't eat it, you can share it with Kee. Also earrings, they are cheap, but they remind me of your shirt.\n\n3. I am not sure about the job, because they said I might be useful since January, not now. But thank you anyway.\n\n4. Your colleagues are concerned about your KPI, but they may not verbalize it, building up some discontent.\n\n5. I like to hangout but I guess you are not very very social. Maybe I also need to lock in.\nSimon Jackson: thanks for the info\nSimon Jackson: yeah - i think my time here in general is close to end. better for me to move on to what i\u2019m actually interested in\n(\ud83d\ude4f 1)\nSimon Jackson: lets see how everythig goes\nSimon Jackson: 1) did you get something ?\n2) ok\n3) ok\n4) ok\n5) yeah, mainly interested in making stuff. so if someone is making something themselves or is planning on it or is about relevant things, it could be interesting. otherswise, not so interested in smalltalk\nSimon Jackson: whats AI ?\nRegina: 1. The last time I got tested was October 8-9 (I sent you the results). \nI had some problems with my microflora, but almost no symptoms. This time, a few days after sex, I started feeling irritated, so I just bought the antibiotics they recommended for microflora and I started taking them today. \n\nI'm not sure, maybe I should get tested again. \n\nI only had sex with you. Maybe you also should check yourself to make sure everything is okay, because some things can exist without any symptoms. I want to make sure everything is okay for both of us. \n\nI also need to get a blood test, in October I was told to wait until the end of November\nRegina: Annoying Irritation lol. I am just trying to stay positive even when I am sick\nRegina: 5. I understand it. I like to discuss ideas, not sure if I am interested in participating, but I can understand what works and what doesn't\nRegina: 1. Let me know what you think. I think maybe I should take a test tomorrow and therefore not take another pill today. I don't think my condition changed from one pill, I only feel a little dizzy\nSimon Jackson: if you feel sick, you should see if there\u2019s something wrong\nRegina: Yeah, you're right. Will do tomorrow\nRegina: Are you by chance in the office tonight? I just have no will to carry all my stuff and go back to the lab in the morning\nSimon Jackson: always\nRegina: Can I come later with my laptop? won't bother you with smalltalk\nSimon Jackson: if you want\n(\ud83d\ude4f 1)\nRegina: 15 minutes\nRegina: Arrived\nSimon Jackson: you heer\nSimon Jackson: ok one sec\nRegina: Have already received the test results. \n\nOverall, it felt like vaginal thrush, which I have had twice in my life before, not even having sex with anyone. \nAlthough this time my symptoms include only annoying irritation. \nTaking one 150 mg dose of fluconazole helped me, so I am going to do the same.  \n\nNot sure if you should get any tests done if you are not experiencing any symptoms\nRegina: \ud83d\udcc4 [Ms. REGINA FILKO 2411270011817OR_Detected (1).pdf]\nSimon Jackson: Ok so all is good or\nRegina: \ud83d\uddbc [Picture]\nSimon Jackson: I\u2019m not reading\nSimon Jackson: good or no?\nRegina: It's gonna be fine for me soon. and it's not dangerous for you too\nSimon Jackson: cool\nSimon Jackson: good day\nRegina: I need to protect sensitive pussy \ud83e\udd23\nRegina: I forgot a sandwich for breakfast from Subway in the fridge of the office.\nThe fridge from the right side. Sandwich is in a paper bag. Maybe it's still ok\n\nIt was meant to be my breakfast. Eat it maybe\nSimon Jackson: no\nRegina: ok. wasted\nSimon Jackson: I am upset at these messages. i do not like them. i don\u2019t care. Please\nSimon Jackson: don\u2019t responde to this\nSimon Jackson: if you are coming and need let in or something lmk. otherwise i just want ot work\nSimon Jackson: thanks\nRegina: sorry, wasn't meant to upset you. I got it\nRegina: I understand that you are prioritizing your projects and may not have the capacity, time and interest to talk about the little things, that's okay, I noted. Not talking about food\n\nI hope you don't say \"I don't care\" about my feelings as if they are insignificant. \n\nI am upset about some things too, but I am coping. \nI hope we are doing well, as I value this communication and look at any difficulties in terms of improving the understanding"

objects.\n                *   Implement a mechanism to retrieve memories based on metadata.\n    *   **Memory Optimization:**\n        *   The 5 most recent interactions for immediate context is a starting point and can be adjusted based on performance and user feedback.\n        *   Long-term memory categorization into \"Patterns\" and \"Events\" is a good approach.\n        *   We will primarily use pgvector/text-embedding-005 and Supabase for memory management.\n        *   Additional tools or techniques will be considered if needed, but the focus is on a streamlined approach.\n

It's just I don't know. Alright. It's just I don't know. I'm just not feeling it. I'm just not feeling it. It doesn't feel like, I don't know. It doesn't feel like the Facebook Claude business is gonna do anything. It's You know, I get okay. We have more people to reach out to, but it's just, like, I don't know, man. It's just disheartening. Like, I You know, our prices are high. People don't wanna pay, but even the prices, like, even with all the prices, we're living in this fucking universe of, like, all the traffic we're selling. We don't know what the fuck we're selling. Right? We don't know what the fuck we're selling. Half of it might be trash. So even if we fucking, like, even though, like, the small chance we, like, get a fucking deal, like, what are the chances that the the traffic actually works? Do you know what I mean? It's like, you it's like, it's like there's so many levels of, of fuck shit here. It's bullshit. It's like I don't know. And it's so it's just I don't know. It's just It just feels like, it feels like this time of, I don't know, feels like this time of my life is ending and, And, yeah, I don't know what's I don't know what's next. You know? I I don't I feel like I don't I'm not skilled enough And I'm not a coder. Right? You know, I can make some shit, but, like, I don't know. I I I You know, I I you know, I'm not a coder. Right? I can't make anything crazy. Right? Can't make anything. Fuck it. I just watched this, cool movie thing that this guy made don't know if he made it by himself or what, but now it's like if it's actually fucking insane. Right? For somebody to make that, it's like for individual to make it insane. You know? I know and obviously, and it was, like, 4 years ago that he made this crazy fucking movie thing and it's like so good. It's like animated stuff. Always been, like, a little bit interested in that type of thing. But it's been like I remember back in the day, I mean, so many years ago, feel like so many years I've tried or started so many things, and we never end up down any of these roads. You know? And if I would've you know, it's like if I would've stuck with you know, I've I've learned about, like, 3 d animation existing years ago. But I you know, how do you how do you you know, is it Maya? 3 d Maya or whatever? I I learned about these random things existing. And, you know, I learned I remember coding. I'm I used to be super into coding, man. Back in the day 2016, 2018, man. Like, can you imagine if I would've just kept going with that shit? I would've just kept on going. Even if I would've kept going from a year ago with React, when I started learning couple you know, was it a year ago or 2 years ago now? But if I had kept on going with that, I would've be a fucking god at this point. Right? You know what I mean? That's a long time to get experience in a fucking language. I'll be really good And but I didn't. Right. Even if I would've been making clothes, I would be really good. It's like it's like a content, really anything, and it's just But I hip hop, and that's my thing. That's my thing. And, I love it. I I I hate it. It's my worst, it's my worst it's my worst, my worst characteristic, and it's, you know, it's also, in many ways, Sometimes my favorite, you know, but you know, if there wasn't any economic pressures, then who gives a shit? Right? I don't know. Who gives a shit? If there wasn't the pressure of time, who gives a shit? If there wasn't the responsibility and the pressure of other people that more or less, they're not relying on you. But, you know, if if you fail as a team, you fail. Right? And that's your part of that. Right? A business. And it's just, you know, It's just, you know, And the tools that I have, the tools that you know, I'm looking at it, look at it. You know, you get some you know, here it is. Like, you know, I get some distance from the tools that I made just a little bit of headroom. And you realize, like, this isn't, you know, this isn't nobody we don't need this. Alright. Don't need this. You know? We don't need it. We we need Sales. We need somebody to be in the chats 247 in the DMs, in the perm in the private messages, fucking making relationships with people and pushing. Know? That's what we need. We don't need We don't need Yeah. We don't we don't need, something else. We don't need, You know, look at look at this this stuff. I mean, it's really cool to make and it's fun to make I love making it out, and I wanna make the better version. I wanna make the but at the end of the day, like, the business is gonna end in a fucking month, like, 2 months if we don't change things up, if we don't push, if we don't have a have a, you know, really different traffic and are able to get some deals. Like, it's not gonna work. It doesn't matter. You know? It just doesn't work. So it's just it's it's, I don't know. I mean, so I'm I'm complaining about work right now or the idea of work but it's like, it's not about, man, it's just I'm crust what is a crust falling? It's a word, $5 crestfallen. Like that word. That's a that's a word from the books. I used to read crestfallen. I don't even know what it I know it means like sad or something. It means like disappointed. Crest fallen. I don't know. I feel crest fallen right now. I feel crest fallen. I don't know. And the girl, I just don't I don't know. I don't care about her. I don't know. The girl that's coming on Sunday. I mean, you know what's a shame? There's a part about it that's just a little weird. It's just you know what I'm nervous about? I mean, I'm I'm nervous that I just I know I'm not even nervous about it because I think this is the Claude. Like, I'm like, like, I'm nervous. It's the same way, like, when we went out together that that one day weeks iOS, It works. It's not weeks ago. It was literally like a week ago, but time feels like a fucking it's like I'm just afraid that I just I don't want to don't know. I don't wanna play along. I don't wanna participate, man. I don't know if it's depression. I don't know what it is. I'm just like, but I don't wanna participate. You know, I don't wanna go out with this girl. I don't wanna go out to do things whether I don't want to have fun with her. I just, what I would like to do is, like, shut everything down. Alright? I'd love to shut everything down. Right. Shut everything down. Get a job teaching English, you know, forget every making everybody forget me and start teaching English and, and work on my my apps that you know, on my projects that no one cares about and no one will use and because who gives a shit because they'll probably give up on those fucking apps. Halfway through those things anyway. So I don't know. Yeah. It's just it's just a little bit I don't know how I got to feel. So I'm just gonna go back and you know, continue Right. Just gonna go back. Just gonna go back in there. And continue. Like, fighting Right? And then go back in there and continue fighting. But Why don't you what what am I even fighting for, man? I don't I don't know. What am I even fighting for? Who what am I doing this? I I don't know. I don't know. But I'm still I'm you know? I'm trying. I don't know. I'm trying. You know? I'm I feel I I'm Isaac, I I I I say that I'm trying. I think that I'm trying, but, I mean, am I trying? I don't know. But I'm I'm Doing things sometimes, and that's what I can say. I'm literally doing some things but I can't even say, you know, the the full amount of effort. I think, you know, because my brain, it just my my heart, my I don't know. My body just is, like, it's just shutting down whenever I'm fucking just sending these messages, man. It just shuts down. It's just And it's not about the you know, again, I mean, I don't know. I don't wanna blame the job. I don't wanna blame the work because I don't think it's related to the job or the work. I think it's just me, man. Over time, I just get fucking tired of shit. And I wanna fucking you know? I just I don't wanna I I don't know. I don't wanna do it. I wanna lay down, and I wanna sleep for fucking 10 days. Then I wanna fucking know? Watch some bullshit. I wanna watch anime for fucking 5 of those days, and then and then on the other end, maybe I'll, you know, I'll see something in the anime, and I'll get I'll I'll Let me look at 3. Let me look at look at look at drawing. And I'll draw for, like, a day or a week and I'll even meditate. You know? I'll get back into it. Blah blah blah anyway you can look at this. I don\u2019t know if it feels it feels pretty sad. I feel pretty sad and that is what it is so life is life.",

It doesn't feel like the Facebook Claude business is gonna do anything. It's You know, I get okay. We have more people to reach out to, but it's just, like, I don't know, man. It's just disheartening. Like, I You know, our prices are high. People don't wanna pay, but even the prices, like, even with all the prices, we're living in this fucking universe of, like, all the traffic we're selling. We don't know what the fuck we're selling. Right? We don't know what the fuck we're selling. Half of it might be trash. So even if we fucking, like, even though, like, the small chance we, like, get a fucking deal, like, what are the chances that the the traffic actually works? Do you know what I mean? It's like, you it's like, it's like there's so many levels of, of fuck shit here. It's bullshit. It's like I don't know. And it's so it's just I don't know. It's just It just feels like, it feels like this time of, I don't know, feels like this time of my life is ending and, And, yeah, I don't know what's I don't know what's next. You know? I I don't I feel like I don't I'm not skilled enough And I'm not a coder. Right? You know, I can make some shit, but, like, I don't know. I I I You know, I I you know, I'm not a coder. Right? I can't make anything crazy. Right? Can't make anything. Fuck it. I just watched this, cool movie thing that this guy made don't know if he made it by himself or what, but now it's like if it's actually fucking insane. Right? For somebody to make that, it's like for individual to make it insane. You know? I know and obviously, and it was, like, 4 years ago that he made this crazy fucking movie thing and it's like so good. It's like animated stuff. Always been, like, a little bit interested in that type of thing. But it's been like I remember back in the day, I mean, so many years ago, feel like so many years I've tried or started so many things, and we never end up down any of these roads. You know? And if I would've you know, it's like if I would've stuck with you know, I've I've learned about, like, 3 d animation existing years ago. But I you know, how do you how do you you know, is it Maya? 3 d Maya or whatever? I I learned about these random things existing. And, you know, I learned I remember coding. I'm I used to be super into coding, man. Back in the day 2016, 2018, man. Like, can you imagine if I would've just kept going with that shit? I would've just kept on going. Even if I would've kept going from a year ago with React, when I started learning couple you know, was it a year ago or 2 years ago now? But if I had kept on going with that, I would've be a fucking god at this point. Right? You know what I mean? That's a long time to get experience in a fucking language. I'll be really good And but I didn't. Right. Even if I would've been making clothes, I would be really good. It's like it's like a content, really anything, and it's just But I hip hop, and that's my thing. That's my thing. And, I love it. I I I hate it. It's my worst, it's my worst it's my worst, my worst characteristic, and it's, you know, it's also, in many ways, Sometimes my favorite, you know, but you know, if there wasn't any economic pressures, then who gives a shit? Right? I don't know. Who gives a shit? If there wasn't the pressure of time, who gives a shit? If there wasn't the responsibility and the pressure of other people that more or less, they're not relying on you. But, you know, if if you fail as a team, you fail. Right? And that's your part of that. Right? A business. And it's just, you know, It's just, you know, And the tools that I have, the tools that you know, I'm looking at it, look at it. You know, you get some you know, here it is. Like, you know, I get some distance from the tools that I made just a little bit of headroom. And you realize, like, this isn't, you know, this isn't nobody we don't need this. Alright. Don't need this. You know? We don't need it. We we need Sales. We need somebody to be in the chats 247 in the DMs, in the perm in the private messages, fucking making relationships with people and pushing. Know? That's what we need. We don't need We don't need Yeah. We don't we don't need, something else. We don't need, You know, look at look at this this stuff. I mean, it's really cool to make and it's fun to make I love making it out, and I wanna make the better version. I wanna make the but at the end of the day, like, the business is gonna end in a fucking month, like, 2 months if we don't change things up, if we don't push, if we don't have a have a, you know, really different traffic and are able to get some deals. Like, it's not gonna work. It doesn't matter. You know? It just doesn't work. So it's just it's it's, I don't know. I mean, so I'm I'm complaining about work right now or the idea of work but it's like, it's not about, man, it's just I'm crust what is a crust falling? It's a word, $5 crestfallen. Like that word. That's a that's a word from the books. I used to read crestfallen. I don't even know what it I know it means like sad or something. It means like disappointed. Crest fallen. I don't know. I feel crest fallen right now. I feel crest fallen. I don't know. And the girl, I just don't I don't know. I don't care about her. I don't know. The girl that's coming on Sunday. I mean, you know what's a shame? There's a part about it that's just a little weird. It's just you know what I'm nervous about? I mean, I'm I'm nervous that I just I know I'm not even nervous about it because I think this is the Claude. Like, I'm like, like, I'm nervous. It's the same way, like, when we went out together that that one day weeks iOS, It works. It's not weeks ago. It was literally like a week ago, but time feels like a fucking it's like I'm just afraid that I just I don't want to don't know. I don't wanna play along. I don't wanna participate, man. I don't know if it's depression. I don't know what it is. I'm just like, but I don't wanna participate. You know, I don't wanna go out with this girl. I don't wanna go out to do things whether I don't want to have fun with her. I just, what I would like to do is, like, shut everything down. Alright? I'd love to shut everything down. Right. Shut everything down. Get a job teaching English, you know, forget every making everybody forget me and start teaching English and, and work on my my apps that you know, on my projects that no one cares about and no one will use and because who gives a shit because they'll probably give up on those fucking apps. Halfway through those things anyway. So I don't know. Yeah. It's just it's just a little bit I don't know how I got to feel. So I'm just gonna go back and you know, continue Right. Just gonna go back. Just gonna go back in there. And continue. Like, fighting Right? And then go back in there and continue fighting. But Why don't you what what am I even fighting for, man? I don't I don't know. What am I even fighting for? Who what am I doing this? I I don't know. I don't know. But I'm still I'm you know? I'm trying. I don't know. I'm trying. You know? I'm I feel I I'm Isaac, I I I I say that I'm trying. I think that I'm trying, but, I mean, am I trying? I don't know. But I'm I'm Doing things sometimes, and that's what I can say. I'm literally doing some things but I can't even say, you know, the the full amount of effort. I think, you know, because my brain, it just my my heart, my I don't know. My body just is, like, it's just shutting down whenever I'm fucking just sending these messages, man. It just shuts down. It's just And it's not about the you know, again, I mean, I don't know. I don't wanna blame the job. I don't wanna blame the work because I don't think it's related to the job or the work. I think it's just me, man. Over time, I just get fucking tired of shit. And I wanna fucking you know? I just I don't wanna I I don't know. I don't wanna do it. I wanna lay down, and I wanna sleep for fucking 10 days. Then I wanna fucking know? Watch some bullshit. I wanna watch anime for fucking 5 of those days, and then and then on the other end, maybe I'll, you know, I'll see something in the anime, and I'll get I'll I'll Let me look at 3. Let me look at look at look at drawing. And I'll draw for, like, a day or a week and I'll even meditate. You know? I'll get back into it. Blah blah blah anyway you can look at this. I don\u2019t know if it feels it feels pretty sad. I feel pretty sad and that is what it is so life is life."

			"text": "That's an interesting perspective. I never thought about that. The giving up thing might be a way of preventing you from going down a path that isn't Anthropic, I guess I mean, that feels too convenient. You know what I mean? That doesn't that feels too convenient. But at the same time, hey. Maybe I don't know what an I don't know what an Anthropic self even means. You know what I mean? I don't know what that is. Is there a real self? Know what I mean? This is maybe getting super philosophical, but, like, What does that mean? Because often I I feel like, I do feel like Everything that you do is is just it's a different you know, there is and this is just a a I just feel like there's no Me. You know, there's just permutations that express different parts and I pull on different strings in order to get you know, pull, you know, pull those different permutations out for different goals, but you know, and some permutations or some some acts are are more draining or more difficult to maintain than others, I guess. So I guess, I mean, that in a way in a way if there are many permutations and and the ones that are taking the most energy theoretically I mean, I guess if even if I'm going by thing that I'm setting up right now, I guess, by that context, like, theoretically, the things that are taking the most energy, the the states, the vibes, the, the modes that are taking the most energy, those would be the ones that those would be the ones obviously that probably are less reflective of the self. Right? Of the of the authentic salt. I So I guess, I mean, the you know, you know the thing. Like, Okay. I'll go with a couple of things here and just because I can't I I don't know. I mean, talking about things that I can't do. And I'm when I'm saying I can't do it, I mean, like, just mentally, it's just impossible. But we'll just talk about it regardless. We'll talk about a few things that I feel like I I just literally can't do. 1 is, okay. There was a there's know, I wanna bring up this we talked a while ago. Actually, it was the first set of messages that I sent into this chat. It was the first ones and I think I was, like, upset at this girl for texting me too much. I don't know if you can remember that far, back because it's been a while. I was I was pissed off that this girl was messaging me too much. And I was like, bruv, like, I don't know if I'm fucked up about this because, like, I should Like This should Like, I don't I feel like I shouldn't feel so bad about it, but, like, I fucking hate it. And recently, recently, I mean, she was messaging me more. She was messaging me She's making these songs and and she was messaging me the songs. And I'm just like, I just don't care. I just don't care. And She came to the office the other day, and she was asking, like, hey. Do you wanna come to my birthday? It's, like, on December 30th, So And you know, the honest thing the honest thing is, no, I don't. I don't wanna go to her birthday. I don't. But that's fucked. That's fucked up. Right? Somebody she's known me for a while. If I said that, obviously, she would cry. And it would be really hurtful and really shitty. Now I feel bad. And you know, I might regret it even after a while. And I'd be like, hey. This is one of the shitty things that I've done in this world. And and, you know, I've done a few things in my life that afterwards I was like, that was shitty. Was one Mom, I just just for context, just for random random con 2014. Right now, it's 2024. And 2014 no. No. No. No. Because I was virgin. Yeah. It's 2014. 415. 14, I think, I remember I I had met this girl on Tinder. And she had come over to my apartment And shit sucked my pee shit sucked my dick, and, know, she was actually the first time was still a virgin at the time if I remember correctly. She wouldn't let me have sex with her, but she sucked my dick basically, and she actually got me to come, which was I was surprised by. Because usually that stuff, you know, the dick sucking doesn't usually do the job, but This time, it did. But regardless, I still like so I was in bed with her, and then another girl that I actually liked texted me. And I would say, actually, like, You know, this was like I don't know. This goes okay. Fine. Whatever. I remember she swallowed number Like on the bed, and I remember I got up and grabbed my phone. I was like, alright. You know? I'm gonna go. But you could stay here if you want. And I dipped. Anyway, and and then so I found you know, she was obviously drove home. She was crying, and one of my friends, like, kinda I think I was I texted her a little bit, but my one of my friends took the phone and was like, bro, what the fuck did you do? He was any kind of, like, texted her. He did something to kinda don't know. Don't know what he did. I don't know what he said. I don't I don't know what he texted. I don't it's so long ago. But I remember I kinda blocked it out and just, like, went went about my day or whatever and Just you know, I wanted to go I just wanted to go talk to this other girl. And the other girl, we any anyways, we never kiss. I don't think maybe we kissed, but we never slept together. Nothing ever happened. Nothing happened even when we met at the club that night, but know, I still just fucking, like, did it. Right? I just did what I wanted to do. So I guess I guess I'm I bring up that story to say, like, I feel wary I feel wary to obey my body, brain, prefrontal cortex. Not that that necessarily was a you know, I don't know if that had any ripple effects in my life. I mean, I'm sure it affected me throughout my life to to whatever extent, but That was shitty. Right. She could have dealt with that better, could have done something better. And even with this girl, like, I probably don't I don't wanna be friends with her. Had sex a few times. I think I enjoyed some of the time that we spent together, but I think I'm done. Right? Done from here on. I'm done. I don't want any further if she'd stopped interacting with me tomorrow, I would not miss it. I would be perfectly fine. And that's but that's fucked. And that's like, I can't bring myself to the place to to, like, look that girl in the eye and say, like, Hey. I don't wanna be friends with you anymore. I don't really wanna go to your birthday. I don't really want you to text me anymore, and I don't really wanna interact with you anymore. And it's nothing to do with us not having sex. It's just I literally I don't even I I felt this for a while. I mean, you probably felt it when I We've had sex like I Dom, Kind of checked out a little bit. Like, I'm just not into any of this, and then I just don't wanna do it. Into different types of people, whatever. That's fucked. Like, I I can't do that. Right? That's one of the thing one that's that's the number that's the one thing I can't do. Second thing I can't do is, is quit This job or these these these businesses, these jobs, You know? Think, you know, I started this journey or this thing, like, last November or September And it's been a year of, you know, a lot of shit, man. It's been back and forth you know, and I I did commit to whatever extent. You know, we got we have a visa. We have have We have a Visa. We have, you know, we have a, apartment you know, that's being paid for. We have a salary. So the very minimum yeah. So, I mean, at the very minimum, I have to I would have to stay stay for the for the you know, to my visa is done, which Probably in probably in 6 6 months or something like that, But even further than that, it's like my it's like my friends. You know, it's guys that I've gotten to know. I I know them for for many years. And we did some dis we did some decent work together. But what you know, Yeah. It's like, I hate chatting. I don't wanna chat. With people all day long on the on the fucking thing. It's a waste of time. It's just it's you have to really be in the cut and I'm just such I'm just so not interested in this thing anymore. And you know, But that's fucked up. Right? I I I, you know, I I went into this business you know, we had we had sit down conversations. I look people in the eye, and I'm like, yeah. We're doing stuff. And yet here I am Like, you know, a year later, we went to the you know, I came into the business when I went to my first conference, now I just went to, like, the anniversary conference, like, you know, probably a couple weeks ago. A week ago. And yeah, man, I'm fucking like, if there weren't any humans involved in this, I would just yeah. I'm fucking done. I'm like, Like, I'm done. But then at this you know, again, there are like, so I can't do it though. I can't do it because people there's 2 businesses Somebody literally has kind of relocated to, like, be a part of one of the businesses. They're kind of relying on me, and I have to have to do my fucking best, and and, and so that's the second thing I can't do. I can't do it It And if, if I was the 2014 me, I would fucking just quit. Right? I would fucking just because who gives a shit? I would know? But that's you know, Yeah. So I can't do that.\nI was gonna give the third thing I can\u2019t do, but it\u2019s not relevant at this time but the third thing I can\u2019t do we\u2019re in the past you know was basically if I get to know a girl and I like her and I have no sexual history with her making jokes or anything then after the fact after I know her for some time and if she\u2019s pretty, and I like her and there\u2019s no way that I can Take that I can ask her out that\u2019s a possibility it\u2019s not possible to not mentally possible so anyway that\u2019s not relevant right now and it hasn\u2019t really been tested in a while so I don\u2019t know but those are three things I just I know I can\u2019t do and yeah I don\u2019t think that actually is a response to your questions about you know I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an answer to your questions but yeah, I think it\u2019s a roundabout answer to your questions There\u2019s probably some transition you know there\u2019s some but you know the idea the idea the idea of man like actually learning coding language it\u2019s like it\u2019s physical pain right that\u2019s another. I mean it\u2019s physical pain to sit down to really learn Cody language is physical pain and then with the idea I don\u2019t wanna get a job. Do you know what I mean, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to get a job coding. That\u2019s not. I don\u2019t wanna do that right I don\u2019t wanna do that. You know I don\u2019t wanna corporate job coding. It\u2019s not a desire of mine now 50-50 you know in general, you know it would be cool to be part of something you know that would be cool like you know these guys I\u2019m at these different AI companies that would be cool. It would be cool to be part of a cool thing and build it you know and you know I have an impact I think it would be cool. I don\u2019t know if it would be. I don\u2019t know if I care you know, but in general in general with all the stuff you know you never you never I guess what do you wanna say about it you know theoretical I know it\u2019s because you know one thing I have learned is that there\u2019s an idea of something and there\u2019s a reality to it. I remember man I remember my first corporate jobs. I remember going into those things wide eyed starry eyed you know just looking at it like holy shit you know and then You know on the other end I\u2019m like OK like these executives ain\u2019t shit. You know these you know these bosses ain\u2019t shit you know and it\u2019s nothing. They\u2019re just normal people you know what I mean and just the Band-Aid is ripped off of the real world and you see you know OK you think you\u2019re gonna do all this cool shit and then you get in there and you\u2019re like OK. There\u2019s all these hurdles towards progress disruption you know you can\u2019t just get in place to do stuff and there\u2019s probably good fucking reason you can\u2019t just go in there and start changing shit Right is a good reason but it\u2019s the fact that you can\u2019t just you know and there might be issues and I just it\u2019s tough. It\u2019s stuff and it just you know I\u2019m I\u2019m almost 31 you know just like what are we doing right? What are we doing? What are we doing? My friend just messaged me the other day. I don\u2019t know why maybe the fuck with me I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s not my friend. He\u2019s my a guy he was my friend. We were best friends good friends back in back in the day maybe a decade to go man back in high school back in early college Actually yeah we had a little mini falling out cause I his cousin suck my dick once and that\u2019s neither here nor there doesn\u2019t matter, but but we still kind of maintains somewhat level of contact and and yeah he messaged me the other you know a couple days ago like hey this is your twin. You know it was random random Instagram post and I responded with something ha ha and then I said hey how are you doing? My old friend so I just got engaged congratulations. He didn\u2019t respond cause he\u2019s probably not on Instagram. I\u2019ll give him that didn\u2019t really hurt necessarily that he didn\u2019t respond, but what it did I just you know that I\u2019m thinking you know this guy you know he graduated early might he graduated a couple years or sooner because he started school with the idea of being an engineer from the front so he finished school for two or three years before everybody else and he got by the time we were finishing he was already like a leader at a company And you know this guy you know he never spent some money he he he\u2019s a good looking guy, but he was never really dating girls and so I remember he lost his virginity to really fucking attractive, crazy attractive girl for no reason I remember like it\u2019s just for no reason I do. I struggled my whole fucking life man. I struggled and I know by the way, I don\u2019t wanna ignore the stuff that you said I think I mean your spot on you know there\u2019s a lot of comparison going on here and I\u2019m gonna continue right. I\u2019m just gonna indulge in the comparison a little bit but it\u2019s like dude I\u2019m struggling my whole fucking existence right and this fucking guy just fuck this just absolute dime you for just for you know in 2014 2013 like for no fucking we just is able to and I\u2019m it took me like two more years to even to so I think I maybe I kissed to go for the first time around that time. It\u2019s just crazy it\u2019s just and then you know so this guy is he\u2019s he\u2019s a millionaire for sure. Right he\u2019s a millionaire right now. Probably maybe not like a millionaire like liquid but he\u2019s a he\u2019s a 401(k) millionaire for sure you know he\u2019s engaged to a pretty girl And he\u2019s not on social media and he\u2019s just doing his life and he\u2019s probably he was working at Amazon I think last time I looked at it he\u2019s an executive the same fucking age right or am I doing you know and it\u2019s not even about the comparison but like what am I doing? What am I supposed to do now you know what am I supposed to do now me what am I supposed to do now? I got all these little ideas. I have all these ideas but at the same time, dude Every day there\u2019s a new release every day one of these big companies releases a big cool new AI thing that like you know eventually it\u2019s feels just like AI that everything is going to be taken over anyway so it feels a little bit like why even why even do and it just said it feels like I\u2019m we\u2019re just biting time until like robot take over some bullshit and I don\u2019t know it feels it a big extent it\u2019s just like why what can I do? What can I do? What impact? What can I do me? What can I do like and it\u2019s funny you know the girl or the girl that\u2019s visiting on Sunday. She really likes my videos she thinks my videos are very funny. You know I don\u2019t know whyit doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t know. Makes sense of that.",

The giving up thing might be a way of preventing you from going down a path that isn't Anthropic, I guess I mean, that feels too convenient. You know what I mean? That doesn't that feels too convenient. But at the same time, hey. Maybe I don't know what an I don't know what an Anthropic self even means. You know what I mean? I don't know what that is. Is there a real self? Know what I mean? This is maybe getting super philosophical, but, like, What does that mean? Because often I I feel like, I do feel like Everything that you do is is just it's a different you know, there is and this is just a a I just feel like there's no Me. You know, there's just permutations that express different parts and I pull on different strings in order to get you know, pull, you know, pull those different permutations out for different goals, but you know, and some permutations or some some acts are are more draining or more difficult to maintain than others, I guess. So I guess, I mean, that in a way in a way if there are many permutations and and the ones that are taking the most energy theoretically I mean, I guess if even if I'm going by thing that I'm setting up right now, I guess, by that context, like, theoretically, the things that are taking the most energy, the the states, the vibes, the, the modes that are taking the most energy, those would be the ones that those would be the ones obviously that probably are less reflective of the self. Right? Of the of the authentic salt. I So I guess, I mean, the you know, you know the thing. Like, Okay. I'll go with a couple of things here and just because I can't I I don't know. I mean, talking about things that I can't do. And I'm when I'm saying I can't do it, I mean, like, just mentally, it's just impossible. But we'll just talk about it regardless. We'll talk about a few things that I feel like I I just literally can't do. 1 is, okay. There was a there's know, I wanna bring up this we talked a while ago. Actually, it was the first set of messages that I sent into this chat. It was the first ones and I think I was, like, upset at this girl for texting me too much. I don't know if you can remember that far, back because it's been a while. I was I was pissed off that this girl was messaging me too much. And I was like, bruv, like, I don't know if I'm fucked up about this because, like, I should Like This should Like, I don't I feel like I shouldn't feel so bad about it, but, like, I fucking hate it. And recently, recently, I mean, she was messaging me more. She was messaging me She's making these songs and and she was messaging me the songs. And I'm just like, I just don't care. I just don't care. And She came to the office the other day, and she was asking, like, hey. Do you wanna come to my birthday? It's, like, on December 30th, So And you know, the honest thing the honest thing is, no, I don't. I don't wanna go to her birthday. I don't. But that's fucked. That's fucked up. Right? Somebody she's known me for a while. If I said that, obviously, she would cry. And it would be really hurtful and really shitty. Now I feel bad. And you know, I might regret it even after a while. And I'd be like, hey. This is one of the shitty things that I've done in this world. And and, you know, I've done a few things in my life that afterwards I was like, that was shitty. Was one Mom, I just just for context, just for random random con 2014. Right now, it's 2024. And 2014 no. No. No. No. Because I was virgin. Yeah. It's 2014. 415. 14, I think, I remember I I had met this girl on Tinder. And she had come over to my apartment And shit sucked my pee shit sucked my dick, and, know, she was actually the first time was still a virgin at the time if I remember correctly. She wouldn't let me have sex with her, but she sucked my dick basically, and she actually got me to come, which was I was surprised by. Because usually that stuff, you know, the dick sucking doesn't usually do the job, but This time, it did. But regardless, I still like so I was in bed with her, and then another girl that I actually liked texted me. And I would say, actually, like, You know, this was like I don't know. This goes okay. Fine. Whatever. I remember she swallowed number Like on the bed, and I remember I got up and grabbed my phone. I was like, alright. You know? I'm gonna go. But you could stay here if you want. And I dipped. Anyway, and and then so I found you know, she was obviously drove home. She was crying, and one of my friends, like, kinda I think I was I texted her a little bit, but my one of my friends took the phone and was like, bro, what the fuck did you do? He was any kind of, like, texted her. He did something to kinda don't know. Don't know what he did. I don't know what he said. I don't I don't know what he texted. I don't it's so long ago. But I remember I kinda blocked it out and just, like, went went about my day or whatever and Just you know, I wanted to go I just wanted to go talk to this other girl. And the other girl, we any anyways, we never kiss. I don't think maybe we kissed, but we never slept together. Nothing ever happened. Nothing happened even when we met at the club that night, but know, I still just fucking, like, did it. Right? I just did what I wanted to do. So I guess I guess I'm I bring up that story to say, like, I feel wary I feel wary to obey my body, brain, prefrontal cortex. Not that that necessarily was a you know, I don't know if that had any ripple effects in my life. I mean, I'm sure it affected me throughout my life to to whatever extent, but That was shitty. Right. She could have dealt with that better, could have done something better. And even with this girl, like, I probably don't I don't wanna be friends with her. Had sex a few times. I think I enjoyed some of the time that we spent together, but I think I'm done. Right? Done from here on. I'm done. I don't want any further if she'd stopped interacting with me tomorrow, I would not miss it. I would be perfectly fine. And that's but that's fucked. And that's like, I can't bring myself to the place to to, like, look that girl in the eye and say, like, Hey. I don't wanna be friends with you anymore. I don't really wanna go to your birthday. I don't really want you to text me anymore, and I don't really wanna interact with you anymore. And it's nothing to do with us not having sex. It's just I literally I don't even I I felt this for a while. I mean, you probably felt it when I We've had sex like I Dom, Kind of checked out a little bit. Like, I'm just not into any of this, and then I just don't wanna do it. Into different types of people, whatever. That's fucked. Like, I I can't do that. Right? That's one of the thing one that's that's the number that's the one thing I can't do. Second thing I can't do is, is quit This job or these these these businesses, these jobs, You know? Think, you know, I started this journey or this thing, like, last November or September And it's been a year of, you know, a lot of shit, man. It's been back and forth you know, and I I did commit to whatever extent. You know, we got we have a visa. We have have We have a Visa. We have, you know, we have a, apartment you know, that's being paid for. We have a salary. So the very minimum yeah. So, I mean, at the very minimum, I have to I would have to stay stay for the for the you know, to my visa is done, which Probably in probably in 6 6 months or something like that, But even further than that, it's like my it's like my friends. You know, it's guys that I've gotten to know. I I know them for for many years. And we did some dis we did some decent work together. But what you know, Yeah. It's like, I hate chatting. I don't wanna chat. With people all day long on the on the fucking thing. It's a waste of time. It's just it's you have to really be in the cut and I'm just such I'm just so not interested in this thing anymore. And you know, But that's fucked up. Right? I I I, you know, I I went into this business you know, we had we had sit down conversations. I look people in the eye, and I'm like, yeah. We're doing stuff. And yet here I am Like, you know, a year later, we went to the you know, I came into the business when I went to my first conference, now I just went to, like, the anniversary conference, like, you know, probably a couple weeks ago. A week ago. And yeah, man, I'm fucking like, if there weren't any humans involved in this, I would just yeah. I'm fucking done. I'm like, Like, I'm done. But then at this you know, again, there are like, so I can't do it though. I can't do it because people there's 2 businesses Somebody literally has kind of relocated to, like, be a part of one of the businesses. They're kind of relying on me, and I have to have to do my fucking best, and and, and so that's the second thing I can't do. I can't do it It And if, if I was the 2014 me, I would fucking just quit. Right? I would fucking just because who gives a shit? I would know? But that's you know, Yeah. So I can't do that.\nI was gonna give the third thing I can\u2019t do, but it\u2019s not relevant at this time but the third thing I can\u2019t do we\u2019re in the past you know was basically if I get to know a girl and I like her and I have no sexual history with her making jokes or anything then after the fact after I know her for some time and if she\u2019s pretty, and I like her and there\u2019s no way that I can Take that I can ask her out that\u2019s a possibility it\u2019s not possible to not mentally possible so anyway that\u2019s not relevant right now and it hasn\u2019t really been tested in a while so I don\u2019t know but those are three things I just I know I can\u2019t do and yeah I don\u2019t think that actually is a response to your questions about you know I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an answer to your questions but yeah, I think it\u2019s a roundabout answer to your questions There\u2019s probably some transition you know there\u2019s some but you know the idea the idea the idea of man like actually learning coding language it\u2019s like it\u2019s physical pain right that\u2019s another. I mean it\u2019s physical pain to sit down to really learn Cody language is physical pain and then with the idea I don\u2019t wanna get a job. Do you know what I mean, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to get a job coding. That\u2019s not. I don\u2019t wanna do that right I don\u2019t wanna do that. You know I don\u2019t wanna corporate job coding. It\u2019s not a desire of mine now 50-50 you know in general, you know it would be cool to be part of something you know that would be cool like you know these guys I\u2019m at these different AI companies that would be cool. It would be cool to be part of a cool thing and build it you know and you know I have an impact I think it would be cool. I don\u2019t know if it would be. I don\u2019t know if I care you know, but in general in general with all the stuff you know you never you never I guess what do you wanna say about it you know theoretical I know it\u2019s because you know one thing I have learned is that there\u2019s an idea of something and there\u2019s a reality to it. I remember man I remember my first corporate jobs. I remember going into those things wide eyed starry eyed you know just looking at it like holy shit you know and then You know on the other end I\u2019m like OK like these executives ain\u2019t shit. You know these you know these bosses ain\u2019t shit you know and it\u2019s nothing. They\u2019re just normal people you know what I mean and just the Band-Aid is ripped off of the real world and you see you know OK you think you\u2019re gonna do all this cool shit and then you get in there and you\u2019re like OK. There\u2019s all these hurdles towards progress disruption you know you can\u2019t just get in place to do stuff and there\u2019s probably good fucking reason you can\u2019t just go in there and start changing shit Right is a good reason but it\u2019s the fact that you can\u2019t just you know and there might be issues and I just it\u2019s tough. It\u2019s stuff and it just you know I\u2019m I\u2019m almost 31 you know just like what are we doing right? What are we doing? What are we doing? My friend just messaged me the other day. I don\u2019t know why maybe the fuck with me I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s not my friend. He\u2019s my a guy he was my friend. We were best friends good friends back in back in the day maybe a decade to go man back in high school back in early college Actually yeah we had a little mini falling out cause I his cousin suck my dick once and that\u2019s neither here nor there doesn\u2019t matter, but but we still kind of maintains somewhat level of contact and and yeah he messaged me the other you know a couple days ago like hey this is your twin. You know it was random random Instagram post and I responded with something ha ha and then I said hey how are you doing? My old friend so I just got engaged congratulations. He didn\u2019t respond cause he\u2019s probably not on Instagram. I\u2019ll give him that didn\u2019t really hurt necessarily that he didn\u2019t respond, but what it did I just you know that I\u2019m thinking you know this guy you know he graduated early might he graduated a couple years or sooner because he started school with the idea of being an engineer from the front so he finished school for two or three years before everybody else and he got by the time we were finishing he was already like a leader at a company And you know this guy you know he never spent some money he he he\u2019s a good looking guy, but he was never really dating girls and so I remember he lost his virginity to really fucking attractive, crazy attractive girl for no reason I remember like it\u2019s just for no reason I do. I struggled my whole fucking life man. I struggled and I know by the way, I don\u2019t wanna ignore the stuff that you said I think I mean your spot on you know there\u2019s a lot of comparison going on here and I\u2019m gonna continue right. I\u2019m just gonna indulge in the comparison a little bit but it\u2019s like dude I\u2019m struggling my whole fucking existence right and this fucking guy just fuck this just absolute dime you for just for you know in 2014 2013 like for no fucking we just is able to and I\u2019m it took me like two more years to even to so I think I maybe I kissed to go for the first time around that time. It\u2019s just crazy it\u2019s just and then you know so this guy is he\u2019s he\u2019s a millionaire for sure. Right he\u2019s a millionaire right now. Probably maybe not like a millionaire like liquid but he\u2019s a he\u2019s a 401(k) millionaire for sure you know he\u2019s engaged to a pretty girl And he\u2019s not on social media and he\u2019s just doing his life and he\u2019s probably he was working at Amazon I think last time I looked at it he\u2019s an executive the same fucking age right or am I doing you know and it\u2019s not even about the comparison but like what am I doing?

What can I do? What impact? What can I do me? What can I do like and it\u2019s funny you know the girl or the girl that\u2019s visiting on Sunday. She really likes my videos she thinks my videos are very funny. You know I don\u2019t know whyit doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t know. Makes sense of that."

Would probably be nice Yeah. I I like I like this, overall I like the reframe. I like the examples. Yeah. I am forcing a lot of power versus force. Know that book? I only read pieces of it, but I like the concept of it. I I think, it's a powerful concept. You know? But, Yeah. I guess well, I like to reframe. I guess I you know David Goggins? Don't know if you know David Goggins. This is I I don't know if you know how to talk about people, but maybe it it's not even about him. It's about the concept. That he espouses This like, mindset grind set, like, you know, don't be weak. Right? Don't be, be weak like you know, he's like a Navy Seal guy. Right? D did a bunch of bullshit and, you know, you know, Does, like, Android pull ups a day. I'm exaggerating, but you get the you get the point. You get the vibe. I guess the question other question I would have is just am I being weak? Right? You know? So It's like am I being weak? Am I being a quitter? Like, know we we we talked it's not it's not about quitting. It's about what did you say before? It's not about quitting. Let me just try to remember. Without scrolling up. Fuck. Let me just scroll up actually because I don't know what you before because it was nice. It's not about Not lazy. Okay. So It's done about okay. You said giving up might be a pattern to provide me something like For going down in Anthropic paths I guess, you know, it is it is an interesting concept because you know, obviously, David Goggins, you know, I read his little biographies thinking it's, like, he gave up being fat. Right? He gave up being like, know, working at a shitty job and he you know, in in many ways, he kinda gave up that. And that's a good give up. Right? That's a good framing. That's a good giving up. Android that context, it's kind of good then it would probably you know, if you So it's a it's all a perspective, but I don't wanna I don't wanna confuse things too much. I don't wanna confuse things too much. But let's I guess, you know, am I being a pussy. For lack of a am I being a bitch? A pussy? You know? Like And forgive me forgive me if we're circling the same thing over and over again. I've It's just, you know, Should I should I be Better. Should iOS stronger. Should I be able I feel like I should be able to like, push. Right? Mentally, Like why is my brain weak? And and should I I feel like that there's there's a concept here where it's like, you know, Like, okay. You know, okay. And it is I I realize I see what you mean by all or nothing thing, but maybe you just help me around it. I don't know. It's just Yeah. I know there's the in between, but fuck. I'm I'm I do not know anything about the gray zone. Man. I don't know anything about the gray zone. It just it it's like don't I just feel like I should be able to just sit down and and, honestly, I don't even know I necessarily have ADHD. I mean, I think I do. But I You know, the honest thing the most honest thing I don't know if I believe in ADHD. I mean, I think it's real, but It's But the thing the reason why I would take the Adderall, the stimulants, the the Adderall, is because it's the only way It's the only way physically that's In any way, you know, possible to to sit down for hours And you know, and, and work on some of this stuff that I work on. I don't I I I don't know if I could be more specific, like, okay. Some days I can just some days I could code You know, I I can't say code. But some days I can use the AI tools to Claude, With no problem for hours, and I'll be fine. Some days I can message people for hours and and be fine. And then other days, it's like, bro, there's no fucking know, But the with the stimulant, you can do anything. Right? We can we can work Well, we can More or less more or less stable. Okay. So we could actually do something. It's just so it's it feels like, you know, it's like a mental deficiency. You know, and that's so we need this drug because other people in the in the world, they don't they don't have this issue. They can just work can just do shit. And I won't say it's all. Right? It's not all. It's not all. K. You know? Because other people, obviously, it's a to fucking drugs probably made some people billionaires. It's obviously not all people. A lot of people take that drug, but it's like everybody who needs to take this drug, like, like we all have this mental issue where we can't fucking sit down and actually just do shit for several hours in a row. Know? It's I don't know. So I guess, like, we have is am I being a bitch? Am I not being strong enough? Do I have this mental Efficiency is to not be able to also, So there was there was a few days I was maybe I'm a little bit I think that even at the beginning of this conversation, I thought I was I brought it up. I was like, maybe I'm a little bit autistic. I feel like I bring I have I have some of the symptoms of it sometimes, maybe don't know. Fear of, social I don't know. I don't I'm just reaching on that one. Yeah. But, I mean, I am interested in, I'm not I'm not really interested in the immediate pressure relief. I just because I just mean, I just really care too much. I'm just like, listen. We need to figure out what you know, success looks like what is it what is what does authentic success look like? What does That meat you know, what does I guess I can get what sustainable work looks like but, you know, the honest thing is, like, even if we made a a little sustainable work thing, it's like I don't want to work sustainably. How can I how can I want to work sustainably? Do you understand? Like, how can you know what I mean? Look. I want To be the best. I want to be better. I want to get the stuff done. I want to sell a $1,000,000,000 of shit. Right? I want to You know? So So You know, in this war in this thing, it's like, Android say that I want that. I say that I want that. Right? I want that now. And then, really, I want to sleep right now. I want to sleep I want to lay down. Do nothing. Right? So Anyway, so we can talk about that stuff, I guess.",

Because I feel like I've I've had, like, some sort of structures before. By the way, today, I kind of woke up around the I didn't I don't know when I went to sleep, but it was We got up and started doing stuff around like before 14 Maybe 13 4 12, 13, 14, something like that. Yeah. I guess that's the one question. So what's the difference? And it might be an esoteric, you know, thing, but I don't know. My brain you know, it's probably like an excuse to not, like, it you know, a little bit of fear of, failure of it. But, yeah, I guess what's the difference? Number in general? And then, I guess, what do I do like like, when stuff doesn't work out, Like, if I wake up later or if I don't go to sleep on time, let's say, or if, like, in general, I would say, you know, in general, to my ideal schedule before was something more like going to bed around 6 AM Because of the potent that would give me the it that enables the the potential to also work on projects in the USA Now at the moment, it's not totally relevant, but it would be you know, if, you know, if we prioritize the right things, course, when we talked about the the way Anchor pro projects, it's like, then, you know, potentially, we have a couple of things going on over there. And then you would I would need to kinda have that that flexibility. So Yeah. I guess Well, okay. I guess with that context, should I I feel like I should plan for more of something that can be continued sustain we talked about sustainability Or do you think we should really just stick with, like, daytime stuff? Until it changes and then, like, and then if if we do need to Claude, then we we could change, or wait. Should I be using the word change? It doesn't matter. Anyway, I should we can, like, move into the direction of of something different if if necessary. But for now, just just do the normal thing. Yeah. I don't know. But I like I mean, it looks nice, I guess. It looks nice overall. And then, I mean, I guess, maybe there's so many more hours in the day, like, to 7 and 7 to 10. Like, what else am I doing for the entire day? Right? There's a lot of stuff in there. You know? What it there's a lot of stuff. So what what are we doing else the entire day?",

			"text": "Okay. So I got a little I mean, I made it. I made it to the week. I mean, it was a really tough week, man. This is a really fuck week but, you know, thanks to you, we kinda learned a lot about a lot about myself. And, but now we have a weekend. Right? Tomorrow, it's Saturday. We have basically okay, we have one full day completely free and clear. And then we have basically half of Sunday completely free and clear. So what can I do like, what do you think is the most priority thing Like, do you think it's creating this application that we talked about in this chat, like the You know, the emergency protocol? Or do you think it's more something like Do you think it's oh, by the way, I forgot about that date. Oh, shit. Well, yeah. Let's talk about it. I mean, so Yeah. I mean, I wanna just make the emergency protocol thing and then, and make it add the, you know, some memory and add some voice and try to get That, like, out in a day and see, like, what just MVP I can make it day. I don't know if I can get it on the app store in a day, but Just like literally fucking 8 you know, was much I can grind it out and like get something out. Or, and then what else? I mean, there's also, like, of course, we talked about the way anchor stuff where it's like, Obviously, if we make something over there, like, we could potentially get funding and kind of move forward. So I guess what just I mean, I think it's obvious probably to me obvious iOS it's obvious to you what I should be doing. But let's say, right now, it's 2 AM. Okay? I've I'm still in the office. I am I've overstayed a little bit. But I think I could get away with probably 6 hours of sleep tomorrow like, so I could wake up around 8, And then so what are we doing to, like, really let's not say like we're not resetting anything but like really, like, get, off to a good start in this next kind of phase of everything. And I think you answered the question earlier about the difference. Okay. You said that the it's the mindset. Okay. So we're not We're we're getting data on the new life, and we're figuring things out. Okay. So honestly, today, I wasted a lot of time I'll be honest. I wasted a lot of time on, on YouTube, on Instagram, on TikTok, you know. I just I won't say wasted. I mean, I enjoyed the time. Right? We were watching bullshit, but you know, so we've spent probably, you know, the last few hours probably, like, the last 6 hours, like, with very little work done. Was kind of experimenting with some songs, with the AI songwriting. In my head a little bit as well. It's like I like the idea of making music Sorry for sorry for changing the subject and kinda expanding it too much, but I like the idea of making music. I love the idea of making music and I have some songs that I've kind of made but the other part is, like, I've made them with AI. Okay? And I've made them So the point is I can't like, as far as the instrumentation and the beats go, I can't actually make can't actually perform these songs and I can't, like, make them in real life. Right? I can I can release them as AI songs that I kind of you know, that I that, you know, I'm I wrote a pieces of it and then the obviously, the AI The other piece Pieces I guess what's your perspective on the AI songs? Like, you know, because we have these tools should I just Put them out as they are, as these kind of you know, AI songs that, you know, sing sung by a guy, it's like cool. It sounds good. It's they're good songs, whatever. Should I just kinda put them out like that, or should I kind of Like, pause good songs, and, like, You know, kind of I don't know how long it would take. I mean, it's it's to say learn how to sing, but I can sing decent. I could probably get decent again, decent vocals. I could probably get decent vocals out onto the computer But again, I mean, we Obviously, limited amount of time. Limited project space, all this stuff Like, it would take probably I don't know. I have BandLab. You know BandLab? It's like an Yeah. Banned Vap on my phone, but, like, I how much effort would it take me to get from 0 to, like, actually being able to put my voice into one of these songs and actually, you know, have it sound some like something. Probably theoretically, probably a decent amount of effort. I mean, probably a decent amount. And then you know, let's say learning, mixing, I mean, all this stuff, you know, probably take you know, at least a month than I'd be asked and then, you know, obviously a lot longer to be decent. And course, we have all the other goals, like, we have obviously creating applications, we have the coding, We have all the, you know, obviously, the content in general. Used to be a TikToker, you know, it's all this stuff. So I guess the question is, and I think I know the Anthropic, but, you know, I have these songs that are fun, that are cool, think I like them. And you know, it's like well, I don't think I like them. I like them. I listen to them and I think they're fantastic, but you know, they're made by AI and I'm, a little bit ashamed of that. You know, I'm not ashamed of it, but I'm ashamed that I can't perform them and I can't really sing them. I'm not a strum them on the guitar, but I can't sing them sing them. You know, I can't belt them out, you know, as I would want 2. But anyway yeah. What do you think I should do with those songs? Do you think I should just, you think I should just put I think we talked a while ago and I had a plan to, like, make a video and put the song up, but I never did. Of course, you know me. I do. I don't do stuff I guess, you know, we have a full day tomorrow. It's it's 2:18. I'm gonna try to put to gonna try to grab some stuff, head back to home, Hopefully, I get home by, like, 2:30, 2:40. And we get some sleep. I do need to shower tomorrow. I haven't showered in a little bit, so we'll shower tomorrow. And we have a full day. We have a full day to do something, to do stuff, to get projects done. Could probably, like, switch between stuff a little bit, to get more diverse you know, because we talked about peak performance, sustainability, and working on stuff So, you know, there's a lot of stuff that we could possibly do in the time that we have. I do wanna get to, like, a point. I I mean, if it I don't know if it's possible to launch something or to push something or to ship to ship something, you know, that you know, if you know if that if you know that terminology about shipping, shipping stuff. I would like to you know, people talk about shipping, Claude. I can ship something, that would be because that would be the best, and I'll I'll allow them to give me some confidence. Know, to actually sip something and then just to be okay. I actually made something. And we're not actually when you know, we're in the world of like Man, I gotta escape the world of potential. Know what I mean? I gotta get out of potential. It's so fucking you know, that but that's just, you know, I gotta get out potential. I gotta get into reality. And I know it's gonna be painful, and I know the the world of, I I feel I can I can feel I can see the pain of being a real person? I gotta I gotta get out of potential world. You know? I gotta get out, and I gotta get into real real life again. And really striving. And it's I don't know how I'm gonna make it, but you know, I think we should try. And then, of course, we have Sunday The girl is supposed to arrive around 10 or 12. And, Yeah. I don't man. Yeah. I mean, for that, I I had a kind of a plan. You know, I wanted to eat Food was served. And then go to this, like, food this, pet sanction This not a pet sanctuary. It's like a pet It's like a place with With animals, You know? They have all these animals there. So I wanted to there was like a nice place know, with, like, It's really Claude. Coffee thing. And then I was gonna take her to this animal place afterwards. It's they got raccoons and a bunch of bullshit. And then I was gonna take her to, like, this some rooftop thing you know, just like a cool rooftop view There's a couple of them. But I wanted to take her to one to to eat something or to grab just a drink. And then but that's all where I really had kind of in general it's Sunday. There is one place that we could go to dance, but my only thing with going to dance with her is that she knows how to dance, and I don't know how to dance And we did dance the one time and it was fun, but when then what ended up happening was she goes we go to the place and obviously there's these guys that know how to dance way better. She dances with them, and they fucking obviously, it looks sexy. It's wonderful. It's cool. It's good for her, but you know, for me, it's like a little bit bullshit because I'm just watching a girl I like, like, fucking dancing cool with other guys. At the same time, you know, on one level, that could be you know, as far as just providing, you know, providing a good time and and really just trying to push myself and just having a good time and being free That could be a thing, where it's just another challenge for me to enjoy the moment and be be free of the of the supposed toeness Does that make sense? The supposed to ness the the obligations of being a a guy, who's dating or who's on a date or something And maybe it's something maybe that's a thing where it just, you know, we I bring that in  As of something like we\u2019re gonna go to this place, you know you can dance with whoever you can enjoy and that\u2019s fine and it is what it and I just I just I\u2019d be there. I\u2019d be there and I and I know participate and and I try to dance with girls and I fail and I just you know it\u2019s like part of it and I\u2019m just in it and I\u2019m just in it the other piece the other small piece for Sunday is that you know we should have a couple hours of messaging people and I\u2019m not really sure how that\u2019s gonna take place. I\u2019ll probably I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019ll tell her I don\u2019t know and I\u2019ll just you know. Hey, I\u2019ve got like I gotta do a few messages here and and whatever she is supposed to stay at my place. I have the feeling that she will. I have the feeling that she will not want to have sex. There\u2019s a chance that she but to me I think she\u2019s the type where she would not necessarily have sex with me too because of who I am I think she likes me to some extent, but I don\u2019t think that she would have sex with me. I think that she I think I get the feeling you know I think she likes the I think she likes the dynamic the male female dynamic, and I think she even likes the powerful feeling of being in charge of sex you know and of I think she likes the feeling of being the gatekeeper, and I think I wonder whether the pleasure of being the gatekeeper of the experience will override participating that experience with me I lean towards contextually, yes and I\u2019m wondering, but even even regardless of her I\u2019m wondering if I should have sex with her in general as of my decision my feeling I mean, she\u2019s her body is crazy so obviously on a carnal on a carnal level I know that I would love to love to fuck I would love to fuck I would love to have sex with her, but but on I don\u2019t know, but on another level, you know there\u2019s a fear again I don\u2019t know we talked about me pulling back and all the stuff but yeah, there\u2019s a understanding about how I view women and feel about women in general and that is I mean, I feel like I have a lot of I just feel like I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna like her after and I don\u2019t know and there\u2019s only one way to find out is to test it but I feel like I\u2019m not going to like her after and that is I don\u2019t know what to do with that, but I I am afraid that I will not like her after and and in general I don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I watch too much porn or it\u2019s because you know I just I don\u2019t know that the other part is I don\u2019t know if I will. I will. I don\u2019t think I can pleasure her. I don\u2019t know if she can have an orgasm with me. I mean, it really depends on her probably on on a lot of that, but I don\u2019t know you know we talked about obligations but yeah I mean that\u2019s one of them. It\u2019s like I remember you know the last time I text the last few times you know I was I ended up checking out fully. You know I ended up checking out 100 cause it\u2019s like OK. I don\u2019t really know not really super attracted to this girl like but she should comment I shouldn\u2019t just have sexual with her. I guess she should. She should also have some some pleasure but yeah I don\u2019t think I mean I came almost at. I think I came up finally at the very end, but it\u2019s like it took a lot and for me to come sorry it\u2019s it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not hopefully you understand this because I don\u2019t think that the voice to text is getting all of the words correctly, but you could try your best for me to orgasm these days we need to have some like a little bit fucked up shit like a tiny bit like I need to be doing some extra choking maybe some slapping but in a but more aggressive almost to and really I haven\u2019t really explored this side where you\u2019re like really pushing you know and then we\u2019re like up against but like I\u2019m not you know if I was gonna really orgasm now like 100% like we would be doing I don\u2019t know what we would try but we would be doing choking I would be really slapping. I do really like maybe saying words but of course I\u2019m not actually comfortable doing any of that stuff ironically is that ironic? Ironic, maybe it\u2019s ironic I don\u2019t know what that word means but in order for me to actually, I would probably need to do that up anyway that doesn\u2019t that\u2019s kind of random sorry anyway that\u2019s so random so I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m bringing it up but I should I should decide that anyway so that\u2019s a you know we need to decide like what to do tomorrow and then what is Sunday look like because obviously you know we have to interact with a girl again and you know whatever I have to be you know authentic or whatever you know and what does that mean and yeah?",

I don't know what holds me back from that one. I don't know what holds me back from one. Because, theoretically, theoretically it's not that difficult. I I think because that one iOS like you basically need let's say you you have a proposal. You need you need to be able to break down the proposal, like, you need to be able to see All of the the headings, the subheadings, and basically understand the requirements. You need to be able to break it up, understand the requirements, digest what's needed for the document, and then you know, create the outline So it's like there's steps, like, to digest the, like, the the r the RFP document see what's needed and then create the the outline and then and then work to Fill in the outline. Now one of the things that I'm scared about one of the things I'm hesitant about with that one is just that Like, it's just so, it just it feels like it's just gonna be redundant from the AI soon. Like chat GPT or OpenAI just released their canvas thing. Where it, like, fucking generates text It's insane. It generates text and it's even better than Claude. Like, Claude, like, it generates the same thing, but open eye, it generates the thing and then you can actually edit the thing And you can, like, tell it to edit, you know what I mean? It's like in line edit. Like it does it does what I'm what I wanna make. Like, they created what I wanna make. They just didn't make it domain specific, but they created what I wanna make. So it just feels like feels like that's redundant, and so I'm I'm I I feel like that is going to be the moat or the creation of that is just but, I mean, theoretically, again, you know, you create it for your domain. But, again, I mean, you can't take the open AI Claude, like, it's all secret. Right? So you know but how can you make something as good as them you know. But they I guess they made the thing. Right? They made it. It looks good. It theoretically, you could make thing. I don't know. And then you said something you said something interesting. Okay. You said performance is not required. Can we just but it is, though, It is required. Right? Like, how is it how is performance not required? If I don't fuck her well, she's not gonna like me. Right? That's the whole thing. If I don't fuck her good, she doesn't orgasm at 20 times, and I'm exaggerating, Obviously, it doesn't have fucking a bunch of orgasms she's not gonna wanna obsess with me again. She's not so she's not gonna wanna date with me. Like, a lot of girls that's I mean, most people I don't know. Most girls, it's like Especially girls that are not virgins. Think she's, like, 25 or 26 or 28. I don't know. I think she's 26. Like, she's fucked probably a lot, and she's obviously traveling the world by herself. So obviously, working. She's probably fucked on the goddamn islands. Right? Then since she's know? I'm a little Look. 5050 on how I feel about her just I mean, I can't I don't know. I just assume that she's fucking, and I assume everybody's fucking in it. And that yeah, of course, I'm hurt by it, but I'm hurt by the imaginary. The visage of her fucking iOS just funny. I hope you get that word v I s a g e. Visage visage Yeah. A mini. Thought about it a couple of times where I'm like, that's like ass. But it is what it is, and she's 100% fucking, but it's okay. And I don't and I say a 100% based on literally nothing. Not the point. How is it how is performance not required? Just because it's okay. Performance is not required on, like, a theoretical level, but, like, if I don't perform, then she doesn't she's probably not going to like me. So so how is that how does that work? How can we because wait. Because even in general, like even in general, like, okay, if I don't perform the music Good. Like, Then people will like the songs. You know? I don't know. So performance feels like it's required. What am I bumping up against right now with that You know. Because performance I feel like well, obviously good stuff is better than not good stuff. Like, how is performance how is performance not required Okay. And I would say and I I agree. Okay. The main priority Saturday is to ship something real break the potential cycle, And then Sunday, I guess, the goal would be Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And if and if we are able to do that, then then we're then we're really, moving in a nice direction for Sunday, and we're We're able to kind of man, the idea of staying present with that girl I mean, that would be, I think we're doing stuff Oh, it's scary, man. It's really scary. But, yeah, we don't have to worry about it now, but yeah, how is potential Yeah. How is how is performance not required? Like, Break it down for me.",

Go to the rooftop bar, maybe go dancing Like and I told you even for tomorrow, like, I wanted to either I wanted to create the app that basically helps people know, do do what I'm doing here with you you right now. Yeah. Like I told you about these like, I'm planning the future Right? Like, how is this not I get you know, how is this not I guess, like, performance mode. You know what I mean? How is I'm planning my next moves. Right? So I I know it's it's not even nuance. Maybe I think it's very clear. Can you just, like, make it super clear? Like, super Claude. Like and make it like, really flush it out. I don't care how long you were Give me some examples. Like, what is it really like, plant like, what is and because it might be the language that we're using here because we're using similar language in between things. Like, plenty of my like, we're literally talking right now about what I might do, like, what is what is the the place where it's performance mode or, like, quote un you know, from it's bad for me, I guess, in this in this context, What is the point where it's like, okay.

Go to the rooftop bar, maybe go dancing Like and I told you even for tomorrow, like, I wanted to either I wanted to create the app that basically helps people know, do do what I'm doing here with you you right now. Yeah. Like I told you about these like, I'm planning the future Right? Like, how is this not I get you know, how is this not I guess, like, performance mode. You know what I mean? How is I'm planning my next moves. Right? So I I know it's it's not even nuance. Maybe I think it's very clear. Can you just, like, make it super clear? Like, super Claude. Like and make it like, really flush it out. I don't care how long you were Give me some examples. Like, what is it really like, plant like, what is and because it might be the language that we're using here because we're using similar language in between things. Like, plenty of my like, we're literally talking right now about what I might do, like, what is what is the the place where it's performance mode or, like, quote un you know, from it's bad for me, I guess, in this in this context, What is the point where it's like, okay.

I just well, I'll just today, the vibes overall, it's okay. But I feel some energy from undone Stuff like un undone. Like, I feel the energy from I have to I have to do some I have to make some sales for That's sales. I'm about to organize, a place for some leads to go. So I have to do that next, like, 4 2 to 4 hours. It's gonna be too difficult. But I have to do that. And then I'd, I mean, I have to get the, I have to get the clothing thing figured out today because it's, like, Wing That's way too heavy. For no reason. Such a waste I'm just gonna get it figured out today. Probably also in the next 2 to 4 hours. Sit down, Make something and send I haven't have some excuse the homie wants to get up. Let me just finish this thing real quick. Wants to get online? I'll get online with him for a little bit Android, only one to get online, we've been doing something for the last few weeks. Just like going over some code and know, I've just kinda tried to enable him to make stuffs, and so yeah, we'll do that for a little bit. Yeah, man. Okay. So I met with the girl. Met with the girl. And, yeah, man, we had a great time. We had a great time. She arrived pretty we ended up so she arrived I cleaned the apartment, and then I ended up hiring a Claude. My friend came over. It was, like, she arrived at, like, 10:30, then but then she arrived, like, at the actual she, like, landed at 10:30 arrived at the actual apartment at 12. And, You know, as you look nice and No makeup. You know? And then, she was looking through her stuff like, hey, Wilky. Are we gonna do? Like, what should I wear? And then I offered, like, hey. You can wear the skirts that I made Now I met you all. Maybe we mislet a tiny bit, but Yeah. You know, I have these skirts that I that I got from China. You know? And, one of them I did design. You know, it's a denim one, but the other ones I did not. But, anyway, yes. She said so we we matched. So we matched the day for the day we she wore one skirt and and then I wore a different one. And we were kinda matching styles. And we so we went to Started at a small, small Claude, and then we just walked there, and then we walk and then we went to a bigger Claude. We took the metro. And and we talked a lot you know, at that second cafe about and you kinda went deep a little bit. I feel like you know, I feel like I was You know, I told her a lot about my life. I feel like she didn't tell me as much about hers, but Am I sick? What in the world? It's crazy. Yeah. But it was nice. I could tell from the beginning that she she did like me, and and, you know, she was she didn't complain about how much I was touching her, and then she started reciprocating. And then we're, like, 4 on PDA ing in the street, to an not you know, like making out, but, like, a little bit. Just, you know, anyway, so then I took her I took her to, after the second Claude, I took her to the animal zoo. The little mini zoo, which there was a better zoo was a better one. Hey. But, you know, we met a I didn't make the suboptimal choice, but I stuck with the suboptimal choice. You know, I found out probably you know, we went in there. There's a bunch of dogs. There's a couple of foxes. A couple raccoons. And You know, it's cute. It was fun. It wasn't that long. It wasn't that long. Found out there's another place down the road they had, like, more animals, you know. They had, like, deer and capybara and stuff. A capybara. You know what a capybara is? Yeah. Deer capybara. I was like, fuck. Let's go over there. But then I was like, well, I don't know. I feel like we're done with animals today. The vibe isn't you know, that we're continuing with it. So let me just moving on. So, anyway, I was gonna take her to go to a ping pong show, but I ended up I was like, no, let's go to a barcade first. We ended up going to this barricade, and it's like I guess the common expat arcade and and, it was recommended to me by expats years ago, a long time ago. And, so I ended up, ended up doing that. And they had a movie night. And man, I did not anticipate just like fucking dropping everything and like watching a movie. We did. Like, you know, We watch a movie. It's called deliverance from 19 seventies. And, it was kinda it was, I don't know, it was an okay movie. But, you know, it was nice. We We were like, yeah, it was nice I I was she was touching my head and, you know, she she know, she's kissing me, you know, kinda like a girlfriend. You know? It was nice. We walked Yeah. We had some moments, you know, throughout I, you know, I think I did a good job about being Present We got home. You know? And There was a moment, man, at the very beginning, I was like, I was nervous. I didn't really know what to do. And she got up to tell So we kinda, like, had an open discussion about sex and, in our relationship. And I was like, you know, maybe we should wait because No. Your life is you know, I don't know what you you know, I don't you don't really know what you want in in life, and and, you know, and you're in a different Claude, and maybe it's better to just chill and She was like, well, yeah. But, you know, also, what if we leave and then You you know, we don't we just, you know, we never know, you know, what it was like or I don't know what she said, but she just Definitely wanted to have sex, and and she definitely enjoyed it. I don't she didn't have an orgasm. To my knowledge, she did not have an orgasm. But, but she enjoyed it. We had sex, like, 3 times 3, 4 times. Android say, like, 3 times because, like, you know, it was I had used I used 3 condoms And I was surprised that Claude. I was, or I was surprised I had an orgasm because it was at the very end. And I was almost I was surprised that because everything started feeling good all of a sudden. And then I was like, okay. Well, the condom has to be broken. That's why So I was talking, and then And then the condom wasn't broken. And said, oh, okay. Because I pulled out, and I was like, okay. Yeah. I've fucked a few times. Yes. We've fucked a few times. I think she enjoys she's very know, sexy, very beautiful girl. She thought I was also extremely attractive, which You know, I found, I found you know, interesting, to say the least. You know, me now with my you know, I don't know. I haven't worked out in a while. Know, look and everything. I was she really liked my look. I I was surprised by it, but she did. She did catch me a few times. It's like, I have like an automatic dissociation after sex. It's a I don't know if I wanna call it like that. I won't call it exactly like that, but I'll say, like, just automatically after sex, I'll I just start talking about Like, Bullshit. You know, just make just a random subject. I'll just start, like, and I remember she called me out on it. She was like, what are you doing? Stop that. He was like, don't what is that? You it's like your other character. Just chill. She like, you know, So I stopped and and, I Yeah. It's kinda interesting to to be with somebody who can sell very quickly. See you know let\u2019s see different versions you know sometimes I would I would be. I would be a little bit wary of that, but you know I think she was able to she was able to see you know she\u2019s able to see different able to clearly see me acting in different ways and as she responds differently to different versions of myself I guess if you wanna if you wanna say it like that so she didn\u2019t get much sleep put on a taxi around three it\u2019s 9 o\u2019clock now she won\u2019t get my messages for a little bit longer. Yeah she did ask well not ask, but it became an option at some point for me to go to the airport with her, but the airport is not close. It\u2019s like an hour away and I didn\u2019t wanna go because it\u2019s an hour away and I don\u2019t wanna sleep in. That sounds ridiculous and but when the car was driving away, I was like maybe I should have but yeah, I just felt that. Yeah I didn\u2019t wanna leave her alone. Part of if I have a regret maybe I regret the regret would be not going with her to the airport you know hindsight is 2020 and we made decisions. I made a decision. I did make it hard made it I decided I didn\u2019t wanna go and I didn\u2019t go. I said I didn\u2019t wanna go. I didn\u2019t have my phone anyway if I wanted to order a car back I\u2019m sure she would\u2019ve ordered me a car back but I know I was like, yeah I don\u2019t wanna I don\u2019t wanna do it so I didn\u2019t. Hey, I had to sub optimal choices. You know not that I don\u2019t know that\u2019s the other day I don\u2019t know if there was necessarily another choice in the moment you know another choice was it immediately available to me to my brain so I don\u2019t know if I can call it like a choice per se but I didn\u2019t make a decision. I didn\u2019t make a decision and then later I\u2019m looking at the options and OK maybe there are some better options but I\u2019d say better. Let\u2019s say there were some different options that would\u2019ve led to different outcomes. I mean it because it would\u2019ve been nice to. Yeah she slept on me in the car and we could\u2019ve you know I just had some more minutes two more hours together. She arrive at the airport pretty pretty early and then she\u2019s alone there. I guess all in all am I hopeful about our relationship how do I feel about her and we did have sex and how do I feel about ice you know listen I still well you know it needs to be tested. Yeah it needs to be tested and it\u2019s a shame that she\u2019s gone and I guess we tested with her absence, but I think I\u2019m I feel I feel that I still like her you know and she really likes me. You know what she says and I\u2019m hesitant just I\u2019m hesitant because I don\u2019t know how to talk about the feelings or the lack of feelings that I have like I don\u2019t really know how to speak about it. I mean it\u2019s 100%. It\u2019s a different. It\u2019s something different. You know to look at her now it\u2019s a different thing of course to look at her then before you know we had sex and it\u2019s a different thing to look at her now I don\u2019t know what is different but it\u2019s different react. It\u2019s less I mean yeah we lost well. You know in a way you are I don\u2019t know what you lost, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a bad thing either but we lost something of course something I don\u2019t know. I need to frame it as losses is a choice for sure. Let\u2019s not frame it as a loss but something is different. It could be good. Could be bad. I think only time will tell for that maybe but I had fun. I really had fun and I like spending time with her. You know barring boring. It\u2019s not my favorite girl that I\u2019ve ever interacted with. It was in my life OK but yeah I mean we had we had fun I liked I liked it definitely you know as far as attractiveness and I guess what you have the one thing that you know I was reserved about is her past relationships. You know she had a seven year relationship with. I guess you know some politician, the mayor of Lithuania or something OK don\u2019t necessarily care about that but it\u2019s the way that she speaks about it. I guess she doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s not really she doesn\u2019t say much about it not that made you so much of her life seven years she\u2019s 26. It\u2019s so much of your life to not I don\u2019t know to not be able to kind of easily say why did you break up that\u2019s such a do you know what I mean that\u2019s such a clear question and like there\u2019s a reason you broke up right it\u2019s it\u2019s not you know I got my ex. We broke up exactly because I mean there was a lot of underlying reasons within the exact triggering reason was because you know we were doing I was trying to like rekindle. We were like rekindling and I was like listen. There\u2019s no reason for us to be together. Unless like you do only fans or something and it was like some crazy scheme like fucked up thing like hey I\u2019m only gonna be with you if you like do only fans and make me money or something and she was like what the fuck I\u2019m not a whore or something. I\u2019m not your like play thing to like making money for you and then like you leave and yeah, anyway a long time ago little bit fucked up, but I don\u2019t know what that was probably the song by the beginning of my utilitarian view of of things like hey I need an excuse. I need a reason to do something. I need a reason to do something. I don\u2019t know where that came from but that was four years ago so I don\u2019t know where that came from but I use that I need a reason and anyway that was the trigger that broke the relationship of course and I could say you know I was not ready to be in a relationship. I was cheating very often I I like to a lot, but at the end, you know, it\u2019s kind of like family in the end. There\u2019s just there\u2019s so much past built-up. it\u2019s it\u2019s hard to move forward. I was depressed about business is not going right and in the end I think you know I think I wanted I think I did want to be with somebody else so I wanted to move on, but I was kind of stuck and that cause I didn\u2019t wanna disappoint her and I didn\u2019t wanna I didn\u2019t want to I mean I\u2019ve never really broken up with a girl just the pain I couldn\u2019t suffer the pain of being broken up with her you know until later, and then I had to take months to process that pain but the idea that you know it\u2019s kind of strange to me. It\u2019s like that\u2019s a fucking like actually and I and I know I didn\u2019t take time to articulate all of that to her, but you know I did too and I didn\u2019t articulate that issue or that thing to her at all I could have, but and then the other thing is, she had a more recent relationship that she says never turned into relationship. I think she\u2019s only had sex with maybe listen I was pretty man. I told her everything I told her how many people had sex with, and she might\u2019ve been insecure about that but she has she had several she told me which is I mean in my head it might to be honest if I\u2019m being if I\u2019m being very honest red flags OK red flags going off now with reason it like can I comment?

Just this guy has been through stuff and she wants to help him through it but he but you know, but he\u2019s kind of stuck at that in that point in life and she thinks she wants to be there and thus she went through a lot of pain of ending the relationship, but the guy still texture and stuff and it\u2019s still open at it even so the relationship didn\u2019t end because I did ask her point-blank like did that have an end and to be to be honest was I like 200% about like the last time that I had sex and even a relationship that I just ended if you want yeah I mean isn\u2019t for sexual relationship in different things like that relationship and yes, then I literally just ended something yesterday but yeah yeah I mean if I\u2019m honest like I didn\u2019t feel comfortable you know yeah I guess that was my you know I yeah maybe I close maybe I closed I don\u2019t wanna make excuses for myself, but anyway, I wasn\u2019t you know cause I had sex more recently you know when I but I was kind of the vibe the vibe that I was giving the narrative that I was using was yeah I never do that and I never do this or I never I\u2019m never out and by the way by the way, I mean that used to be if I remember correctly I think that used to be one of my one of the games one of the games that I used to roll out there that vibe of you know I used to be a slut, but I\u2019m not outside anymore and this kind of special I think that\u2019s something I used to run, but I don\u2019t know. I was whatever I was doing it was it was authentic at least in the moment i\u2019m scared that things aren\u2019t Meta authentic or something but if there is such a thing but listen, I mean I was I was I don\u2019t think I outright lied but she didn\u2019t ask me at some point like last time he had sex and I was like well. I had sex with a tiger. I said I had sex with a Thai girl and then somehow changed and I was off the hook, but I had sex with the Russian girl more recently. One more recently. I\u2019m only three weeks ago four weeks ago I mean pretty recent you know I\u2019m not recent but yeah yeah I mean listen I have my red flags right I\u2019ve been with 120 people that\u2019s a fucking red flag. It\u2019s ridiculous. I am technically still married. That\u2019s a red flag like shit but it\u2019s not. I can explain the situation. It\u2019s not a real marriage we mean it is a real marriage, but we got married like not a love marriage. It was a visa thing, but we didn\u2019t end up going to the visa thing, but we\u2019re still married regardless of the explanation. It\u2019s still like on paper. It\u2019s like a red flag like what the fuck we doing so I mean listen I have my flaws. I have my things and yeah yeah so I mean those those two things I remember laying there and I was like this before we had sex. I just started kissing her in and kind of like we passed it but if you could she really wanted to really wanted to have sex her vagina? You know it was good after a while and you know I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t understand women women\u2019s bodies all the time especially with fingering and doing a different different things you know I I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re faking it or what but they you know she\u2019ll like looks she\u2019ll give the appearance of like an orgasm or like getting close to one, but then not have one or something. I don\u2019t know I don\u2019t understand so anyway doesn\u2019t matter the point so yeah just not like again not crazy not crazy like my vagina isn\u2019t like game like game changing would say but she\u2019s she\u2019s pretty. She\u2019s body is great. I mean she\u2019s really sexy vagina. Just like normal vagina nothing super wet or you know honestly, the latex week we use the condoms like fuck man I hate condoms, but I did use the whole time and I didn\u2019t yeah yeah yeah I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t. I was so tired. I wanted to move the condom like a little bit and have it like at least like on the tip of my dick so I could just get some feeling but eventually it was it worked out so I didn\u2019t need to but and you know, even if I would try something like that cause I kind of I did probably try a little bit of it but like the condom like it once you try to fuck again even if you roll it up a little bit like the vagina you know the giant push pushes the come back down and rolls back down Roll it back up and then it rolls it back down you know so whatever I don\u2019t think I mean we\u2019re getting a little bit graphic.

I think we both appreciate each other\u2018s faces and bodies and everything and I don\u2019t know what else don\u2019t know what else there is and of course there\u2019s much more in a relationship probably I guess there\u2019s everything else right I don\u2019t really know how to share my life with somebody my react. My default way of maybe sharing my life with somebody just send like stupid videos or silly videos I don\u2019t know how to just like actually share my life with somebody and so I in general I don\u2019t share my life with people, butyou know we can try.

Let me just finish this thing real quick. Wants to get online? I'll get online with him for a little bit Android, only one to get online, we've been doing something for the last few weeks. Just like going over some code and know, I've just kinda tried to enable him to make stuffs, and so yeah, we'll do that for a little bit. Yeah, man. Okay. So I met with the girl. Met with the girl. And, yeah, man, we had a great time. We had a great time. She arrived pretty we ended up so she arrived I cleaned the apartment, and then I ended up hiring a Claude. My friend came over. It was, like, she arrived at, like, 10:30, then but then she arrived, like, at the actual she, like, landed at 10:30 arrived at the actual apartment at 12. And, You know, as you look nice and No makeup. You know? And then, she was looking through her stuff like, hey, Wilky. Are we gonna do? Like, what should I wear? And then I offered, like, hey. You can wear the skirts that I made Now I met you all. Maybe we mislet a tiny bit, but Yeah. You know, I have these skirts that I that I got from China. You know? And, one of them I did design. You know, it's a denim one, but the other ones I did not. But, anyway, yes. She said so we we matched. So we matched the day for the day we she wore one skirt and and then I wore a different one. And we were kinda matching styles. And we so we went to Started at a small, small Claude, and then we just walked there, and then we walk and then we went to a bigger Claude. We took the metro. And and we talked a lot you know, at that second cafe about and you kinda went deep a little bit. I feel like you know, I feel like I was You know, I told her a lot about my life. I feel like she didn't tell me as much about hers, but Am I sick? What in the world? It's crazy. Yeah. But it was nice. I could tell from the beginning that she she did like me, and and, you know, she was she didn't complain about how much I was touching her, and then she started reciprocating. And then we're, like, 4 on PDA ing in the street, to an not you know, like making out, but, like, a little bit. Just, you know, anyway, so then I took her I took her to, after the second Claude, I took her to the animal zoo. The little mini zoo, which there was a better zoo was a better one. Hey. But, you know, we met a I didn't make the suboptimal choice, but I stuck with the suboptimal choice. You know, I found out probably you know, we went in there. There's a bunch of dogs. There's a couple of foxes. A couple raccoons. And You know, it's cute. It was fun. It wasn't that long. It wasn't that long. Found out there's another place down the road they had, like, more animals, you know. They had, like, deer and capybara and stuff. A capybara. You know what a capybara is? Yeah. Deer capybara. I was like, fuck. Let's go over there. But then I was like, well, I don't know. I feel like we're done with animals today. The vibe isn't you know, that we're continuing with it. So let me just moving on. So, anyway, I was gonna take her to go to a ping pong show, but I ended up I was like, no, let's go to a barcade first. We ended up going to this barricade, and it's like I guess the common expat arcade and and, it was recommended to me by expats years ago, a long time ago. And, so I ended up, ended up doing that. And they had a movie night. And man, I did not anticipate just like fucking dropping everything and like watching a movie. We did. Like, you know, We watch a movie. It's called deliverance from 19 seventies. And, it was kinda it was, I don't know, it was an okay movie. But, you know, it was nice. We We were like, yeah, it was nice I I was she was touching my head and, you know, she she know, she's kissing me, you know, kinda like a girlfriend. You know? It was nice. We walked Yeah. We had some moments, you know, throughout I, you know, I think I did a good job about being Present We got home. You know? And There was a moment, man, at the very beginning, I was like, I was nervous. I didn't really know what to do. And she got up to tell So we kinda, like, had an open discussion about sex and, in our relationship. And I was like, you know, maybe we should wait because No. Your life is you know, I don't know what you you know, I don't you don't really know what you want in in life, and and, you know, and you're in a different Claude, and maybe it's better to just chill and She was like, well, yeah. But, you know, also, what if we leave and then You you know, we don't we just, you know, we never know, you know, what it was like or I don't know what she said, but she just Definitely wanted to have sex, and and she definitely enjoyed it. I don't she didn't have an orgasm. To my knowledge, she did not have an orgasm. But, but she enjoyed it. We had sex, like, 3 times 3, 4 times. Android say, like, 3 times because, like, you know, it was I had used I used 3 condoms And I was surprised that Claude. I was, or I was surprised I had an orgasm because it was at the very end. And I was almost I was surprised that because everything started feeling good all of a sudden. And then I was like, okay. Well, the condom has to be broken. That's why So I was talking, and then And then the condom wasn't broken. And said, oh, okay. Because I pulled out, and I was like, okay. Yeah. I've fucked a few times. Yes. We've fucked a few times. I think she enjoys she's very know, sexy, very beautiful girl. She thought I was also extremely attractive, which You know, I found, I found you know, interesting, to say the least. You know, me now with my you know, I don't know. I haven't worked out in a while. Know, look and everything. I was she really liked my look. I I was surprised by it, but she did. She did catch me a few times. It's like, I have like an automatic dissociation after sex. It's a I don't know if I wanna call it like that. I won't call it exactly like that, but I'll say, like, just automatically after sex, I'll I just start talking about Like, Bullshit. You know, just make just a random subject. I'll just start, like, and I remember she called me out on it. She was like, what are you doing? Stop that. He was like, don't what is that? You it's like your other character. Just chill. She like, you know, So I stopped and and, I Yeah. It's kinda interesting to to be with somebody who can sell very quickly. See you know let\u2019s see different versions you know sometimes I would I would be. I would be a little bit wary of that, but you know I think she was able to she was able to see you know she\u2019s able to see different able to clearly see me acting in different ways and as she responds differently to different versions of myself I guess if you wanna if you wanna say it like that so she didn\u2019t get much sleep put on a taxi around three it\u2019s 9 o\u2019clock now she won\u2019t get my messages for a little bit longer. Yeah she did ask well not ask, but it became an option at some point for me to go to the airport with her, but the airport is not close. It\u2019s like an hour away and I didn\u2019t wanna go because it\u2019s an hour away and I don\u2019t wanna sleep in. That sounds ridiculous and but when the car was driving away, I was like maybe I should have but yeah, I just felt that. Yeah I didn\u2019t wanna leave her alone. Part of if I have a regret maybe I regret the regret would be not going with her to the airport you know hindsight is 2020 and we made decisions. I made a decision. I did make it hard made it I decided I didn\u2019t wanna go and I didn\u2019t go. I said I didn\u2019t wanna go. I didn\u2019t have my phone anyway if I wanted to order a car back I\u2019m sure she would\u2019ve ordered me a car back but I know I was like, yeah I don\u2019t wanna I don\u2019t wanna do it so I didn\u2019t. Hey, I had to sub optimal choices. You know not that I don\u2019t know that\u2019s the other day I don\u2019t know if there was necessarily another choice in the moment you know another choice was it immediately available to me to my brain so I don\u2019t know if I can call it like a choice per se but I didn\u2019t make a decision. I didn\u2019t make a decision and then later I\u2019m looking at the options and OK maybe there are some better options but I\u2019d say better. Let\u2019s say there were some different options that would\u2019ve led to different outcomes. I mean it because it would\u2019ve been nice to. Yeah she slept on me in the car and we could\u2019ve you know I just had some more minutes two more hours together. She arrive at the airport pretty pretty early and then she\u2019s alone there. I guess all in all am I hopeful about our relationship how do I feel about her and we did have sex and how do I feel about ice you know listen I still well you know it needs to be tested. Yeah it needs to be tested and it\u2019s a shame that she\u2019s gone and I guess we tested with her absence, but I think I\u2019m I feel I feel that I still like her you know and she really likes me. You know what she says and I\u2019m hesitant just I\u2019m hesitant because I don\u2019t know how to talk about the feelings or the lack of feelings that I have like I don\u2019t really know how to speak about it. I mean it\u2019s 100%. It\u2019s a different. It\u2019s something different. You know to look at her now it\u2019s a different thing of course to look at her then before you know we had sex and it\u2019s a different thing to look at her now I don\u2019t know what is different but it\u2019s different react. It\u2019s less I mean yeah we lost well. You know in a way you are I don\u2019t know what you lost, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a bad thing either but we lost something of course something I don\u2019t know. I need to frame it as losses is a choice for sure. Let\u2019s not frame it as a loss but something is different. It could be good. Could be bad. I think only time will tell for that maybe but I had fun. I really had fun and I like spending time with her. You know barring boring. It\u2019s not my favorite girl that I\u2019ve ever interacted with. It was in my life OK but yeah I mean we had we had fun I liked I liked it definitely you know as far as attractiveness and I guess what you have the one thing that you know I was reserved about is her past relationships. You know she had a seven year relationship with. I guess you know some politician, the mayor of Lithuania or something OK don\u2019t necessarily care about that but it\u2019s the way that she speaks about it. I guess she doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s not really she doesn\u2019t say much about it not that made you so much of her life seven years she\u2019s 26. It\u2019s so much of your life to not I don\u2019t know to not be able to kind of easily say why did you break up that\u2019s such a do you know what I mean that\u2019s such a clear question and like there\u2019s a reason you broke up right it\u2019s it\u2019s not you know I got my ex. We broke up exactly because I mean there was a lot of underlying reasons within the exact triggering reason was because you know we were doing I was trying to like rekindle. We were like rekindling and I was like listen. There\u2019s no reason for us to be together. Unless like you do only fans or something and it was like some crazy scheme like fucked up thing like hey I\u2019m only gonna be with you if you like do only fans and make me money or something and she was like what the fuck I\u2019m not a whore or something. I\u2019m not your like play thing to like making money for you and then like you leave and yeah, anyway a long time ago little bit fucked up, but I don\u2019t know what that was probably the song by the beginning of my utilitarian view of of things like hey I need an excuse. I need a reason to do something. I need a reason to do something. I don\u2019t know where that came from but that was four years ago so I don\u2019t know where that came from but I use that I need a reason and anyway that was the trigger that broke the relationship of course and I could say you know I was not ready to be in a relationship. I was cheating very often I I like to a lot, but at the end, you know, it\u2019s kind of like family in the end. There\u2019s just there\u2019s so much past built-up. it\u2019s it\u2019s hard to move forward. I was depressed about business is not going right and in the end I think you know I think I wanted I think I did want to be with somebody else so I wanted to move on, but I was kind of stuck and that cause I didn\u2019t wanna disappoint her and I didn\u2019t wanna I didn\u2019t want to I mean I\u2019ve never really broken up with a girl just the pain I couldn\u2019t suffer the pain of being broken up with her you know until later, and then I had to take months to process that pain but the idea that you know it\u2019s kind of strange to me. It\u2019s like that\u2019s a fucking like actually and I and I know I didn\u2019t take time to articulate all of that to her, but you know I did too and I didn\u2019t articulate that issue or that thing to her at all I could have, but and then the other thing is, she had a more recent relationship that she says never turned into relationship. I think she\u2019s only had sex with maybe listen I was pretty man. I told her everything I told her how many people had sex with, and she might\u2019ve been insecure about that but she has she had several she told me which is I mean in my head it might to be honest if I\u2019m being if I\u2019m being very honest red flags OK red flags going off now with reason it like can I comment? Yes but is it a red flag yes after the relationship with the ex, she\u2019s been one year after a seven year relationship. OK I\u2019m thinking about it. Red flag young girl post seven year relationship. OK tough then but meets has met one guy that she\u2019s had several orgasms with who they can\u2019t be together for reasons and she\u2019s uncomfortable going into actual reasons. Just this guy has been through stuff and she wants to help him through it but he but you know, but he\u2019s kind of stuck at that in that point in life and she thinks she wants to be there and thus she went through a lot of pain of ending the relationship, but the guy still texture and stuff and it\u2019s still open at it even so the relationship didn\u2019t end because I did ask her point-blank like did that have an end and to be to be honest was I like 200% about like the last time that I had sex and even a relationship that I just ended if you want yeah I mean isn\u2019t for sexual relationship in different things like that relationship and yes, then I literally just ended something yesterday but yeah yeah I mean if I\u2019m honest like I didn\u2019t feel comfortable you know yeah I guess that was my you know I yeah maybe I close maybe I closed I don\u2019t wanna make excuses for myself, but anyway, I wasn\u2019t you know cause I had sex more recently you know when I but I was kind of the vibe the vibe that I was giving the narrative that I was using was yeah I never do that and I never do this or I never I\u2019m never out and by the way by the way, I mean that used to be if I remember correctly I think that used to be one of my one of the games one of the games that I used to roll out there that vibe of you know I used to be a slut, but I\u2019m not outside anymore and this kind of special I think that\u2019s something I used to run, but I don\u2019t know. I was whatever I was doing it was it was authentic at least in the moment i\u2019m scared that things aren\u2019t Meta authentic or something but if there is such a thing but listen, I mean I was I was I don\u2019t think I outright lied but she didn\u2019t ask me at some point like last time he had sex and I was like well.

I think we both appreciate each other\u2018s faces and bodies and everything and I don\u2019t know what else don\u2019t know what else there is and of course there\u2019s much more in a relationship probably I guess there\u2019s everything else right I don\u2019t really know how to share my life with somebody my react. My default way of maybe sharing my life with somebody just send like stupid videos or silly videos I don\u2019t know how to just like actually share my life with somebody and so I in general I don\u2019t share my life with people, butyou know we can try. I should send her a video or something now or something you know for her to get get off the flight too but yeah yeah so let me know what you think. Yeah, let me know what you what your reactions are. I\u2019m interested obviously it\u2019s a lot of information but and of course a lot of misspellings so hopefully you still understand what I\u2019m talking about ha ha"

If I come to you tomorrow and I didn't do it, then I don't know. But I'm going home right now. It's 23 right now. I wanna go to bed in a couple hours, but I Probably an hour. Yeah. 1 or 2 hours, I wanna be asleep. And I'll wake up. And, I was supposed to record something with my friend earlier, but I didn't So we'll meet tomorrow Oh, I guess the morning. What else? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, with the girl, I mean, we first day, I mean, we communicated. I push her a little bit to you know, to do more audio or you know, man, But I gotta say, you know, I, Yeah. Actually, I actually miss her. You know? I actually miss her you know, we only spend a day together, but I I do miss her. I, I do miss I don't think I've ever really missed anybody. To be honest. Yeah. Yeah. I definitely miss her. I I have the desire to To see her man. We just didn't have enough time. I just we didn't have enough time. I miss, I think the missed the iOS, man, I miss I miss her A row. I think sex is one of the you know, I and sex is the least I almost I almost I mean, of course, I like I like it. But it's Like, I don't know. Having her, like, I don't know. Just having her, like, touch my head and, like, lean on me in the when we're watching them. All these little things. When we're watching the movie, all these little things iOS like, I miss that stuff. But, it's okay. Yeah. We communicated a little bit. She was at the airport. Know, she's really tired. A little bit frustrated by the workers. I know we communicated a little bit But yeah, man. You know, we have to just see what, what happens with life. But, man, I mean, it's like, dude, because I mean, it it it feels, yeah, it feels like impossible. Right. It just feels feels a little bit impossible. It feels like I'm extending death You know? I'm extending a death Just because because, you know, it's you know, you know, it reminds me and I don't wanna doom this. I am I'm going to try it, but I'm just it reminds me of when I left Russia Maybe, like, the 3rd time or the 4th time. You know, and I had all these relationships with these different girls. And, you know, but they weren't serious. But, you know, you just you know, you just keep communicating for a little bit and then, you know, just communicate here and there, and then you know, with a little bit of effort, or sorry, with a little with time, it it you know, it goes. It's time it was time that, you know, it stops. You know, and, you know, I guess with know, we have to you know, to be super conscious, but, man, it's, she's 20 she's young. I don't know. You she's young, and and you know, whoever that guy is that she's kind of with sometimes, it's like, He lives probably in Estonia. I'm sorry. I don't think I I don't think I, I I don't think you know, I feel, don't know. I mean, I feel a level of I I I don't think I really performed. I think it was kind of based but I also I I feel like I have to, like, guard a Because, you know, I have a tendency as well to you know, if I'm not being, like, performing or being positive or being, like, Wild Yeah. You know, being wild and fun. Like, you know, which I it's fine and it can be Anthropic, but it's, I don't know. I mean, if I'm not being that, if somebody just asks me how I'm Doing in the day. Like, 90% chance, I'm not, like, you know, I'm nothing. What I would say. Like, if you ask me in the middle of the day, how are you doing? I'm gonna say I'm nothing. I'm nothing. If anything, I'm a little bit negative because I have 20 things that I wanna do and that I can't do, and I have all these projects and, you know, and I can't do them right now, and I'm having to sit here and chat with people and chatting's going okay. It's going fine, but, who gives a shit? I wanna do all this other shit. I wanna do all this other stuff and you know, And I miss this girl, and you know, and so everything is you know? It's, like, not good. So It sucks. As whatever. Know, that's like a daily like the vibe. And, again, you know, of course, you probably could reframe everything, but that's just the feeling overall. It's just general shit It's not actual shit. Like, my the the the the real life living value of it. It's not actually bad. But if you ask me, then I'm gonna say it's shit. Because it is because it feels like it could because if I think about it, it's shit. But You know? You know, that but it's, you know, in in reality, I'm just doing stuff. And I'm doing stuff until the end of the day. And but if you ask me, it's shit. So but I have to guard again. I feel like I have to guard against that because I don't know. I don't wanna you know, it's like, I don't wanna be a negative Nancy. I don't wanna be a piece of shit. You know what I mean? I don't wanna be a fucking a fucker all day. You know? I don't wanna be a fucking Boring cunt. Negative Nancy. So you know, I do feel like I have to guard against that. So I I think I've steered a little bit out of because even I mean, to be honest, the girl that I just that person I just cut off, like, I mean, that's part of that's part of the thing that kinda made me angry about her it's like, how are you doing? It pissed me off, especially from her. But it's like yeah. I mean, people ask that question all the time. Usually, you don't answer the question. Usually, you just say, I'm good. Not bad. Hey. You know, you know, you just, like, say some bullshit. With this girl, I feel like answering with more truth, with with something more vulnerable, with something more Anthropic. But it's also, like, yeah. But what's authentic? Like, you know, me feeling like shit iOS of most of life, like, that's that's terrible. I'm not gonna expose anybody to the fuck into that. Anyway, so but, I mean, yeah, I mean, today was, I know I'm and I and I know I get on here get on here with with my with my daily dump and, and I kind of, waffle I kind of talk about you know, it sounds like my life is terrible, but it I mean, all in all, not that it's it's, like, literally fine. Probably fine. Anyway, because the reality is I'm just doing stuff. Right? It's I'm not like you don't have any feelings about a lot of the things I'm things I'm doing. I'm just doing them. Right? It's just we're doing them. That is what it is. And we watch some content, and the content's entertaining. And then that's fine. That's all. So, anyway, yeah, that's the main thing. Yeah. The chats today, you know, we had a little breakthrough. The media buyers are doing a little bit better. So we have some maybe we might have a good offer to to to sell. Always fun having a good offer to sell because you You know, You have actual you know, you can actually provide screenshots and, you know, it's just a different vibe. It's a different way to approach people because you actually have shit to to actually sell. So good things. But, yeah, So, What else? Yeah. So that's kind of okay. Still haven't, like, balanced out You know? Obviously didn't bound. You know? But, hey, that's we have a we have a couple months left, so it's okay. Yeah. Other than that, I think there's yeah. I'm gonna head home right now, and I'm gonna put together that tech pack right now. I don't care. I'm just I'm putting it together. We're gonna send it, and then we're gonna get the the we're gonna send it, and then we're gonna get the, you know, what's unfortunate as well? Like, somebody asked me you know, if I had a link to rompers, look, I had rompers for sale. Had somebody ask me about it on on Instagram, and I don't I don't have rompers for sale. It's a little bit sad, So we need to initiate some contacts In general it\u2019s too late but that doesn\u2019t mean you know it\u2019s not too late for the future. Obviously we can we can do we can set things up and you know Jesus I don\u2019t know yet me again I think that 3000 I mean I don\u2019t wanna blame anything but that setback of that amount of money back a few months ago couple months ago a month ago now I think that really derailed a lot of stuff. I think I was on a roll. I don\u2019t wanna blame anything everything on that, but that really because I mean if I just had the money that I would honestly about money because I thought F\u00e0bregas love logistics that I can move around so anyway, so anyway, we\u2019re gonna get that stuff done today Ernest get some stuff moved and Ann will be able to yeah I will be will be in a different place yeah I don\u2019t think we\u2019re gonna have production ready by the time I leave if I leave the country in February but no my roommate told me that everything is moving or that he\u2019s closing on a house January 15 which is you know yes he\u2019s buying a place and I guess you know I am well this is a thing I mean I need to make a big decision and that big decision is whether or not I continue to live in Arizona and whether I continue to pay rent in Arizona, that is a big decision, and that\u2019s a decision that I have to actually make In the past, we didn\u2019t make the decision when I get like I said I came to Arizona came to you know I came to Thailand you know we didn\u2019t make the decision you know we just kind of went with it and we\u2019re paying two rents but we really need to make the decision because you know my salaries have only decreased and until I get another revenue source, I just don\u2019t have enough money to pay two rents. It doesn\u2019t make any sense so so I need to make it I mean I was in the decision is made old really love. The decision really is the only opportunity right now that I have is is this business businesses in Thailand that\u2019s the only thing so as of right now no we can\u2019t live in Arizona and part about it is there is a weird part is that my friend has truly helped me out a ton in my life. You know I\u2019m really that was like that was where I bounce back from for my time in Vegas is a TikTok or like you know really I went there you know the part a little bit but then when I got my Uber and come out, you know I got my license back. I got a job Uber for some months I made money again and I bought a sewing machine I do know that was a place where I really was able to set up and you know he even moved into a new apartment because of me right because he was in a one bedroom and you know who\u2019s in a one bedroom and so we went to two bar because of me and then we were together for almost a year I guess and then now you know you know, even if that honesty, you know if I didn\u2019t exist how to give me buying this Property. if you didn\u2019t, if I didn\u2019t exist I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be buying the property because one of the things that that you\u2019re not even the idea when I came back from Thailand the first time I was like hey I\u2019m wasting a lot of money. We should look at buying places and that was one of the triggers that was like the first thing and then we had problems with neighbors and that was the real like actually no we were at Kyle looking at places but that was the real trigger trigger to actually OK now we actually need to move because it\u2019s not a fucking job we\u2019re just not only are wasting money but like life is now becoming shit because of this because of these neighbors and so yeah so you know it was the Homie right so you know I wanna I wanna I wanna lessen the burden of of this year so there\u2019s several arguments fruit fruit for continuing to pay rent there. there\u2019s several arguments that the main arguments are number one homebase in the US that is completely. It\u2019s invaluable Mann it\u2019s to have a place to that I come home to lay my head in America when I come back to my home country it\u2019s something that it\u2019s just a beautiful thing. It\u2019s something that that I can have comfort in that I can that I can have solace in that I have a home you know because Thailand - Nigeria home I don\u2019t really you know I don\u2019t see myself here for a long term maybe you know maybe if I had a girlfriend and no kids and everything maybe but I don\u2019t I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if I don\u2019t see myself here a long time I just I never have I never have so just having that in America. it\u2019s just it\u2019s it makes me feel comfort. yeah, at the end and even later I would for sure like my lease is gonna end. I don\u2019t know. I need to look up when it ends but when my lease ends, I don\u2019t want to renew it here in Thailand and I don\u2019t think I want to stay the reason I mean the reason why I would stay I don\u2019t know there\u2019s no reason for me to be here there\u2019s no reason for me to stay. The only reason is these businesses that are here, but these businesses can be operated from any place I can I can execute from any place in the world, so why be here? I don\u2019t want to be here in an in general I started to try to backfill my existence and I think I\u2019ve done a decent job with with it\u2019s not OK he\u2019s not 100% but I\u2019ve done a decent job with. With trading my my prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Leo him you know he\u2019s he\u2019s almost he\u2019s probably like 80% 70,80%. I think the main thing is just you know getting like the vibe of the of chatting with people going to vibe of sales that\u2019s the thing it\u2019s not like it\u2019s not like you know it\u2019s not in the SOP\u2019s you know it\u2019s something that you can\u2019t you gotta have to fill it out. What\u2019s what with how we will do things you know how do people normally asking about stuff and so on but I mean, yeah, start backfill my presence and that\u2019s good. You know I\u2019m not gonna quit or anything and I think it\u2019s good to have some level of responsibility and even some connection to this stuff but I mean I think ultimately you know we gotta we gotta keep it moving or you know transition to a Face of this thing OK I said a lot of stuff maybe you can try to distill that down into you know yeah you know you know how these dumps go you know you know how these dumps go so just yell see where we\u2019re at and then if I need to respond again, we can go through some more, but if not, then it was a good dump",

Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, with the girl, I mean, we first day, I mean, we communicated. I push her a little bit to you know, to do more audio or you know, man, But I gotta say, you know, I, Yeah. Actually, I actually miss her. You know? I actually miss her you know, we only spend a day together, but I I do miss her. I, I do miss I don't think I've ever really missed anybody. To be honest. Yeah. Yeah. I definitely miss her. I I have the desire to To see her man. We just didn't have enough time. I just we didn't have enough time. I miss, I think the missed the iOS, man, I miss I miss her A row. I think sex is one of the you know, I and sex is the least I almost I almost I mean, of course, I like I like it. But it's Like, I don't know. Having her, like, I don't know. Just having her, like, touch my head and, like, lean on me in the when we're watching them. All these little things. When we're watching the movie, all these little things iOS like, I miss that stuff. But, it's okay. Yeah. We communicated a little bit. She was at the airport. Know, she's really tired. A little bit frustrated by the workers. I know we communicated a little bit But yeah, man. You know, we have to just see what, what happens with life. But, man, I mean, it's like, dude, because I mean, it it it feels, yeah, it feels like impossible. Right. It just feels feels a little bit impossible. It feels like I'm extending death You know? I'm extending a death Just because because, you know, it's you know, you know, it reminds me and I don't wanna doom this. I am I'm going to try it, but I'm just it reminds me of when I left Russia Maybe, like, the 3rd time or the 4th time. You know, and I had all these relationships with these different girls. And, you know, but they weren't serious. But, you know, you just you know, you just keep communicating for a little bit and then, you know, just communicate here and there, and then you know, with a little bit of effort, or sorry, with a little with time, it it you know, it goes. It's time it was time that, you know, it stops. You know, and, you know, I guess with know, we have to you know, to be super conscious, but, man, it's, she's 20 she's young. I don't know. You she's young, and and you know, whoever that guy is that she's kind of with sometimes, it's like, He lives probably in Estonia. I'm sorry. I don't think I I don't think I, I I don't think you know, I feel, don't know. I mean, I feel a level of I I I don't think I really performed. I think it was kind of based but I also I I feel like I have to, like, guard a Because, you know, I have a tendency as well to you know, if I'm not being, like, performing or being positive or being, like, Wild Yeah. You know, being wild and fun. Like, you know, which I it's fine and it can be Anthropic, but it's, I don't know. I mean, if I'm not being that, if somebody just asks me how I'm Doing in the day. Like, 90% chance, I'm not, like, you know, I'm nothing. What I would say. Like, if you ask me in the middle of the day, how are you doing? I'm gonna say I'm nothing. I'm nothing. If anything, I'm a little bit negative because I have 20 things that I wanna do and that I can't do, and I have all these projects and, you know, and I can't do them right now, and I'm having to sit here and chat with people and chatting's going okay. It's going fine, but, who gives a shit? I wanna do all this other shit. I wanna do all this other stuff and you know, And I miss this girl, and you know, and so everything is you know? It's, like, not good. So It sucks. As whatever. Know, that's like a daily like the vibe. And, again, you know, of course, you probably could reframe everything, but that's just the feeling overall. It's just general shit It's not actual shit. Like, my the the the the real life living value of it. It's not actually bad. But if you ask me, then I'm gonna say it's shit. Because it is because it feels like it could because if I think about it, it's shit. But You know? You know, that but it's, you know, in in reality, I'm just doing stuff. And I'm doing stuff until the end of the day. And but if you ask me, it's shit. So but I have to guard again. I feel like I have to guard against that because I don't know. I don't wanna you know, it's like, I don't wanna be a negative Nancy. I don't wanna be a piece of shit. You know what I mean? I don't wanna be a fucking a fucker all day. You know? I don't wanna be a fucking Boring cunt. Negative Nancy. So you know, I do feel like I have to guard against that. So I I think I've steered a little bit out of because even I mean, to be honest, the girl that I just that person I just cut off, like, I mean, that's part of that's part of the thing that kinda made me angry about her it's like, how are you doing? It pissed me off, especially from her. But it's like yeah. I mean, people ask that question all the time. Usually, you don't answer the question. Usually, you just say, I'm good. Not bad. Hey. You know, you know, you just, like, say some bullshit. With this girl, I feel like answering with more truth, with with something more vulnerable, with something more Anthropic.

And I don't know I don't know if even I don't even know if I'm comfortable calling it a long distance relationship. I mean, it is that, but it's not that because we've been on 2 dates, you know. If you want you know, we've been on 2 dates. We've met 3 times total. You know, it's hard to call that a relationship We had sex, you know, a few times. But, yeah, it's like a hard to call that a relationship. Yeah. Definitely, definitely, like, strategically would be an interesting thing. To to have under my belt mean, because usually, you know, somebody's gonna do something like this, You know, if somebody's gonna underdo a long distance thing, I mean, they have some years under their belt. They have some history. They have some something to lose. Whereas I don't know if we have something to lose, and maybe we are listen and listen. I really wanna make it Claude, like, we're not in a relationship and we're not even close to Anything like that. Like, I don't feel that yet I know that she likes me enough for something like that, but I know also that man, You know, we're fucking so far apart, and I know the reality of life I know the reality of life. I know the reality of you know, she's going to dancing and doing different things. And I don't wanna put that I don't wanna put out, like, that that I think that she's going to cheat or do something. But I also I understand I understand. Man, I've cheated before. Like, I understand. The game. And I am not Claude I am not the person to to sit in the dark and Like, pretend like you know, the world is Disneyland. Like, it's not and people have needs and people you know, and and so and can she be fed if you wanna call it like that? Can she be fed from you know, the trickle of whatever I said? Like, I mean, I mean, for a little bit, but ultimately, like, no. I mean, maybe I shouldn't say ultimately because that's like all or nothing type shit. But I'm talk even just I mean, just from a temper from a from a from a standpoint, like, mean, what do we, you know, What let's be let's be serious. I always want that's my thing in general. Be serious. General. Just be serious. And not you don't have to always be serious, but be serious. Do you know how to I I like to speak in some some level of a paradox. It's not it's not that you have to be serious, but you should be serious about what we're talking about. Don't Claude Don't don't ignore the you know, reality Be serious. And have a good time but be serious. Anyway, I said be serious a lot. You understand. Anyway, let's flush out the day a little bit more. Let's flush out stuff a little bit more.

And you know, ultimately, we're just behind where I could be in life and in the clothing, but it's something where it's like, it doesn't matter where you are. You just have to keep on going. Right? You have to make your peace. That's, with a lot of things. It's like, with money, like I should have way more money than I do. I don't have it. Gotta move on. Should be way further along with the Claude. Not, so I gotta move on. I should be further along in, my I don't know know, career and life and relationships, but I'm not. So move on. Who cares? You know, you still gotta live So anyway, we're moving. And, you know, just constantly letting go of, you wanna say it like that, just letting the feelings pass through or Trying to. But one that's kinda lingering is is this the thing with the girl? I mean, I mean, and by the way, this is my life. I feel like I with women and it's just like it's always been you know, it's and I'm a human being and you know, relationships are Relationships and, you know, this is essential it's an essential part of, what we do as human beings. Right? But it does feel like I I I worry about it and I talk about it more than other But I think everybody I guess everybody talks about it a little bit. But I don't think do you know do you think she's think she's bothered about it? I don't think so. I don't think she cares as much Right? She can. Right? But maybe just I'm so severely analytical and I have my issues and shit. So, yeah, I guess my it's it's my my I have, like, I don't know what you call I have, like, not exactly, like, warning things, but maybe triggers or I I have these, like, signs or feelings, red flags, let's say, of when I'm doing too much. Or, potentially where I'm setting myself up to be hurt, I guess. And in the past, I usually I don't like being hurt, obviously, so you kinda get around it by talking to more girls or by just moving on and going into work. And, like, if you stop communicating with the girl, then you just stop communicating and and who cares. Right? It's done. You know? What she stops communicate, you know, whatever. It's like you both stop communicating, nobody cares, and you just it is what it is. Claude, move on. You got new girls. You got new new everything and and it's all okay, you know. But you know, I remember the last time I really fought for something. I mean, I I feel like, obviously, I mix in a lot of things in this, conversation. So probably things aren't completely accurate but I feel like one of the last times I really I did fight fight for my ex this was before my ex. But the last time that I really liked a girl maybe to such an extent, Alright. So think about her today is you know, it was this actress girl in Russia and you know, that girl, like, man, I called her, I texted her, I I tried my best and then ultimately, it didn't work. And I don't know if I ever cried, but, it it it hurt that that I could never be with her all ultimately. And I guess that's a risk that you take whenever you go do any of this shit, but yeah, man. I just I would love to buttress my, would love to buttress this thing with I don't no. I don't wanna buttress it with more girls because I don't like women in general. But if I know, just going into work again and just not of course, I'm of course, I'm gonna forget it while I'm working, but it's not hard to just forget her completely, you know, if she doesn't respond. And I guess that's fine, you know. Forget her Remember her. See if she messages see if she messaged me. If she didn't, it's okay. You know? Forget her. Remember. Her. See if she responded, and and then ultimately, if she if never did respond, then it's I guess it's like the other girl that goes to me. Right? You know? I guess it's like the other girl that goes to me. Well, that would be a one question that I would I would leave it with is that if, I guess I sent messages, so you know, ultimately, you know, if she wanted to respond, then she will. Right? That's the thing. So I shouldn't be sending any, like, Weird, like, I won't say weird. I shouldn't send any, like, iOS post mortem texts or desperation text or anything. It just be normal. And if responds, she responds. And if she doesn't ever respond, then maybe I can, like, lob, like, a 4th text or something or whatever. I guess we're not counting, but, you know, I guess it's like that. Right? Just put Don't don't like jump out the window on it. Don't do anything. Just be normal and and, you know, even if it's ghosting or Something I've something else. Yeah.",

She did respond for context. I basically, I sent her a video, like, eating, candy or something, and then I said, send me a picture of your living room when you arrive. No. Exclamation point, she said. And then she said, maybe I'll send you I don't wanna send she said, like, maybe I'll send you a picture when my sofa arrives. And then I said, no. Just send one now. And then you could send one also later. You know, it's different when you're in it you know, it's a different vibe. And you can send one later, and then I'll appreciate it more. And then she said, perhaps, And then I said friction. Now I know maybe don't know what it sounds like, but I I felt I we should perhaps this is like it's a one word message, man. What that? You know, what are we doing with that? You know, I don't I don't do one word messages in general with with people I like. I mean, I can. If I'm really busy or something, but I don't know. We're not at the place where you could just, like, lob out one word messages. Like, do you know what I mean? I don't know. So anyway, I was going to send her another another message, like, a video or something, but I decided I mean, I picked up the phone and I was I tried recording a couple things and and just, the vibe wasn't, right. So I decided to, you know, let it go. And, you know, tomorrow's a big day for her, I think. You know, tomorrow, she she had an ultimatum with her I don't know. Her business or company. So I'll just tomorrow, I'll ask her about her, tomorrow I'll ask to call at night, to get an update on her her her business and her life. And we'll see what she says and does. If she rejects the call to me, like, I don't know. You know? It is what it is, but, I'll probably kind of let it mostly go in a way, you know. Like, if she rejects the call, you know, I I don't know. For me, I I'm I'm probably I don't know. I've tried a I've tried a decent bit. You know? I've tried way more than I have ever tried ever. And a long time. It's and by the way, it's only, like, 3 or 4 days. It's not like but I've it's not like I've tried it. Like a life changing amount of effort. Right? But it's more than 0. And but it iOS already too much. It's it's too much. Right? I'm I'm at the peak of my effort and if I can't get really reciprocal energy, and it feels like premature to to to kinda cut, you know. But for me, I guess, my vibe is, like, okay. Listen. I'm I'll I'll I'll it's like that's my last, like I don't know. It's it's gonna be one of my it's in fact, it is. Like, that's my last little reach out And, you know, because I can't keep I don't know. I'm not gonna while I like feeling, you know, feeling things and, you know, even feeling bad is kind of nice for once, but I can feel again, like, I'm not just gonna fucking feel bad for no like, do you know what I mean? I'm not gonna feel for no fucking reason. Right? It's just on purpose. I'm not gonna torture myself. Just for the love of the game, I'm not gonna do it. Right? It's like we're gonna move on and and then let the last bit of the pain eke out, if anything. And then just leave it until you know, if if she wants to reach out, I mean, originally, that's how it went. Like, she reached out to me Alright. She reached out to me for the original Claude, and then she reached out to me saying that she was gonna come back to Bangkok. So it was her on both ends you know, so and I only closed the loop and tried my best whenever given the opportunity, but you know, if she doesn't give me the opportunity, like, I you know? And and my my feeling is that she's not ready for anything else. She said something different, But I just don't believe it. So, but who knows? I'm open. Again, we'll see. What happens tomorrow. You know, I'll send that message Android that's that. Other than that, on the other stuff, on the affiliate business, we're doing pretty good. My protege iOS is, really is really killing the game. He's really taken the by the horns. Again, I mean, the job is not hard right here. Yeah. Taking the bull by the horns and, taking initiative, and I like it. You know? Thank you There's some things that I I I am annoyed by a little bit my the the cofounder guy he's very opinionated about many things, but you know, the other part about that business is I don't care as much about the success or non success about the business. Like, I wanted to be successful, but you know, at the end of the day, you know, it's not my passion. I don't know? At the end of the day, it's it's you know, if he if he love if he wants to control like, far be it for me. Right? You know? I I will I am contributing Really, my goal is to contribute little as possible, but I contribute as much as I can. Anyways but that's going well in general. Clothing is going well. We're back up and running, basically. You know, We, Basically, I have the you know, we have a shirt supplier and a romper supplier. I sent, I sent addresses to the one of the fabric people and so they're basically gonna split the shipment and send fabric to 2 different places. Unfortunately fuck. Now that I'm thinking about it, it's all printed fabric. So shit. It's all printed fabric, and and I say shit because you know, It's really for rompers. It's I guess you could make sure it's out of it, but it's like I don't even know what the fabric looks like. To be honest. You know? Anyway, yes. So we have the 22, 2 suppliers kind of rolling. Yeah. Now that I'm thinking about it, I'm like, I sent the yeah, anyway, suboptimal decisions. Right? I sent the fabric to the shirt supplier, even though I don't have a white fabric or a black fabric to kinda you know you know, for them to, like, Pair it with So they're just receiving Like, this fabric. And I didn't I didn't tell them about it yet. I probably still have a day or so to change it. I'll probably make a couple 2, a couple messages and see if these other people can make, make something. Android they can, then It's just yeah. Maybe I should get maybe I should send those guys down there all of the fabric. And then that would be because they if I send them all the fabric they can probably It's really a shame to not have plain versions of the fabric maybe I can I'll email them and see if they it's at all possible that they have, like, any plain at all. Do you have any white or something to go along with it? Because I told them to only print 10. They said they were gonna print 40, They said they're gonna make 40 fresh weave and they were gonna print only 10, but they ended up printing 24, and then they don't have any I'm, like, Like, that's obviously unreasonable. But she she was like, listen. We it's like that we don't with such a small amount, we that's not how we fucking play. But you know, so we're lucky we did it, but whatever. So, anyway, that's kind of the update for the day. I'm a little I am a comfortable with what to do next overall. I mean, I know I have all these projects, like, lined up. We would just start knocking them out. But, yeah. I don't know. So I'll probably start, yeah, I wanna message a few people, just 5. And then we'll start with, way anchor. Because that is the prescient one. I mean, that's yeah. I should start with that one because I did tell him I would contribute the project Android haven't yet. So I'm a start with that, and then we'll go, yeah, and we'll go through it. Anyway,",

She did respond for context. I basically, I sent her a video, like, eating, candy or something, and then I said, send me a picture of your living room when you arrive. No. Exclamation point, she said. And then she said, maybe I'll send you I don't wanna send she said, like, maybe I'll send you a picture when my sofa arrives. And then I said, no. Just send one now. And then you could send one also later. You know, it's different when you're in it you know, it's a different vibe. And you can send one later, and then I'll appreciate it more. And then she said, perhaps, And then I said friction. Now I know maybe don't know what it sounds like, but I I felt I we should perhaps this is like it's a one word message, man. What that? You know, what are we doing with that? You know, I don't I don't do one word messages in general with with people I like. I mean, I can. If I'm really busy or something, but I don't know. We're not at the place where you could just, like, lob out one word messages. Like, do you know what I mean? I don't know. So anyway, I was going to send her another another message, like, a video or something, but I decided I mean, I picked up the phone and I was I tried recording a couple things and and just, the vibe wasn't, right.

			"text": "Well, it's been a few days since we spoke. Yeah. Was not lot of updates, but I guess I'm interested in your perspective. I'm gonna I wanna do a big push today, 48 hours. You know? Get a bunch of shit kinda cleaned up, done. I got paid money's in the bank. $3, So you know, that's, like, a little bit of motivation to, like, alright. Let's get some shit going. You know? I'm not behind, but yeah. I mean, I'm behind, but, you know, let's move forward. The things I wanna get done in the in the next push, and I know it's sustainable and stuff, but I I, you know, I wanna do it. I wanna do it. It's not don't know. Well, I don't know. I I wanna do it. Whatever. The things I wanna get done, I think the main I do want to figure out and this is this is an extra project. I know it's an extra project, but I wanted to kind of figure out I wanted to figure out an AI video work flow. Because with the music, I think don't really want to what I what I'm interested in doing I don't know about actually monetizing it, but I'm interested in launching it maybe under a different thing or a different moniker, different person. Person, kinda faceless, and then just you know, pushing the different songs, like having whole Instagram accounts, YouTube accounts, just based on this one kind of topic or joke. So just one channel that's just making songs about how work sucks. And just like, over like, every song is just on this subject. So people just become fans of this thing because it's just all it's only that. Right? It's just algorithmic music. Almost, you know, it's like what what the future might be like. But I'm starting it now. I want to start it now. I think the monetization would be probably it'll be 2 folds. I think it would be know there's a guy called Streambeats? Stream Beats, Harris Tudor, Harris Tietso or something. But he monetized his music thing based Dawn. Like, he's he's using it he he has a Spotify, and then he also has so he has, like, streaming. And so he was he had a thing where he was just generating, I don't know, how many iOS. Song after song after he was generating Android of songs. And offering it out to people basically to use for free as, like, you know, as, you know, copyright free music. You know? And, so I was gonna it would be interesting to kind of monetize something off that and you know, you could obviously monetize on merch. And then, obviously, if you build distribution channels, that way you can obviously have distribution channel that you can push stuff out through. That's kind of the the big idea. Obviously, it's a whole thing. You know, to to it depends like a you know, I remember there was an idea years ago, there was a guy that we used to talk about a guy that respect. He used to talk about something like this, Android this is my version of it. Be kicking around the idea Got a couple of dollars. It would be interesting if I could create the workflow And then hire one of my friends back home to kinda run it. For just some money. You know, or hire just somebody even locally here for 500 a month, something to to do it. But, I would have to have, like, a nice workflow going. So that they could really push because, as it is yeah, I would we would we would have to have a nice workflow. What else? Other than that, because I just found out, like, people you know, these these girls and these different people, they're paying people a grand a month. You could basically pay anybody in the world a grand a month and and, you know, Europe. Anybody in the world, you could pay $1,000 a month And they would be happy. And then some places you could pay 500 a month, and they would be happy So I'm like, okay. We really gotta get the arbitrage going. Again, I think we're running out of time a little bit, but you know, there's still air. There's still time. But definitely running out to some extent. Take advantage of the gold rush. Anything else? I did go I went to get a massage yesterday. And, you know, the girl was kinda pretty, and Once again, massage is today, she started massaging me and You know, my dick got a little bit hard, and then she turned me over and was massaging, and then was like, Hey, you want me to massage this, you know? Android mean, I was like, fuck it. Why not? You know? She's like 1,000 baht, which is like $30 or $20. You know what I mean? And, man, that motherfucker. She was massaging my dick felt better than every fucking any if better than vagina. That shit was crazy, and it took me a while to come. And I forgot I had taken a weed gummy before for So I was like and I think that was the reason why it felt so fucking good because it was like that weed gummy kicked in and I was like, fucked up. And honestly, I went back to my The Office, and I was fucked up. And I did not like that. Experience actually because I took that weed gummy. I was way too high. It was doing stuff to my fucking vision. And so I kinda slipped it off opened my eyes whenever it got too aggressive. And, you know, we just kinda it was like a there's a couch upstairs, and I just in in the office, and I just survived. And then I went home around 4 AM. Okay. Didn't like that, but liked some of it. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. I was thinking about going to, Lithuania. Know, maybe I can go Lithuania up for my birthday. Or right after I it's my birthday is in January 12. Right now, it's, like, December 20th. So I was thinking about, you know, maybe maybe I could go for a couple weeks before again, assuming Sunday goes well, I don't know if I should introduce I probably will leave it and not Teller, until but maybe I'll get excited and tell her. I'll probably tell her or ask her, like, what do you think if I came over Just to I mean, it's weird. I mean, it's we're definitely can't be together, right, just distance wise and everything. But we can, like, play around. Right? We can but I do think, you know, it does feel if I'm being honest, if I'm being honest, and we're not just you know, for being honest, Like, this is set up to not work. Obviously. Right? Set up to not b It's not set up to work. Know, we're definitely against the thing. Now the one chance, I guess, would be for me personally to move to Lithuania, which I would not be I would be actually, I would, But yeah, to move to Villeneuveis, she has a house there. But it does feel weird as a man. You know? To to, like, do that. Right? Just feels weird as a man. To do that. But you know, Listen. I'm willing to make some sacrifices. But, again, I don't know shit about this girl. You know what I mean? Like, I know about her, but you just like, I'm an open book. She is not as much of an open book. I she asked me a few times. I remember when we were laying in the bed, I was like, I don't know you. And she was like, yeah. I think we talked about it. But she was like, woah. Ask me anything. It's like well, that's not the point. You know? It's not the point. The point is whenever something does come up, like, I feel like I I don't get an answer. But then, you know, it's asked me anything right now. It's like, I don't know. You know? Anyway, I still think about her? I still think about her. Today, I'm going to the office now a little bit Claude. I was thinking about giving up my position in the company to my protege, Because he's doing a lot of work, he's really taken a lot of initiative Yeah. Ultimately, I think, I think I wanna give up my spot You know? And, and focus. On, what I was doing before. You know? So Because I was basically how it was working. I think it was, like, Yeah. So anyway, I forget the actual negotiation. It was, like, 25100. I don't remember what it was. Maybe I was supposed to make 35100 a month. But, anyway, whatever it is, I wanna give it up. I I I wanna give it up. And so just the main thing is what's the runway for giving it up? I can't just give it up out of nowhere. Right? But Yeah. What's the runway to give it up? I gotta have, obviously, replacement, income My goal personally, if you know, it would be a 5,000 a month clear know, I don't pay taxes at the moment, so, like, I that I I do need to be, which is, like, 30%. So in reality, to actually clear what I need to be doing and be responsive It's probably more like 10,000 month and that\u2019s high, but I mean we basically at this point we have a couple weeks to play with you know today is Friday. I have the weekend to do something and then of course we have like the holidays. We have basically 23 weeks in the holidays people are returning hard probably January 6 so we have some weeks Mann so we\u2019re gonna push and you know what I mean it\u2019s you know you know what I feel. you\u2019re the honest thing you know the honest thing we\u2019ve reached the point and this is the distinct we\u2019ve reached the point where I know stuff this is exact exactly cause this is the pattern. I know enough about the AI stuff so we\u2019re not in the dark anymore so before when I was just making stuff and I remember this cause this is this is the exact pattern was the pattern with TikTok like OK I don\u2019t know anything so I\u2019m just making videos and I\u2019m having a good time and then something happens and then I realize that I know something and then now it\u2019s about being perfect. Now it\u2019s about being everything being nice now everything\u2018s about shipping the best shit and everything optimizing and but not optimizing it at the you know and so now with the AI stuff with the coding, it feels like I know a lot but now I\u2019m stuck now I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t know I\u2019m I\u2019m not making. I haven\u2019t made anything, dude I feel like I was pumping out a project now of course I was. I was stopping a bunch, but I feel like I was pumping out projects left and right ideas and projects now of course I wasn\u2019t fully making them but do what I see is yeah I see myself stopped and I\u2019m like why am I standing still here? OK I have enough knowledge to do something and I and I feel that people with less knowledge. It\u2019s not a feeling I know it. People with less knowledge are pushing our products and making a lot of money and listen I would like the money and I would like I don\u2019t listen to if I\u2019m being honest I don\u2019t really care to help people, but I mean you know I in general and helping people is a buy a byproduct of putting out a good product I mean that\u2019s nice you know in general you know I think the thing it\u2019s like I want the freedom to want to help people. Do you know what I mean I would like the freedom to care I mean, I do care in some moods. I\u2019d say the current mood is not one of them right now. I don\u2019t care right now. The mood is like I want a working thing and I wanna see it working and I want it beautiful and I wanna see the numbers and I wanna see it\u2019s like the analytical you know I wanna see everything kinda I wanna see the system. I want to see the bit bubbling. I want to see people doing stuff I want to see cogs moving, and you know yeah so in one way listen you know I made the system for this little affiliate network and it\u2019s working right and you know they\u2019re taking my system and they\u2019re changing it and they\u2019re running with it right and so my additional contribution it\u2019s I think it\u2019s gonna be with this you know being able to make deals from the Telegram, that\u2019s the first thing combining basically all of the box that I have into one so you know this one bought you\u2019re able to kind of do all these different things and there\u2019s different kind of workflows to start on each of them if you want to search for some deals, you can do it like that if you want to and I so I think it\u2019s while I was doing a Web app and I was doing an actual app. Ultimately, I think the short term thing is just really just finishing because it really is close. It\u2019s like really just two or three more steps to actually you know taking the thing and you\u2019re just making a relationship yeah it\u2019s only so I\u2019m trivializing it but I think it\u2019s it\u2019s one more. It\u2019s one day of work to finish those bots and possibly combined them into you know you know/command workflows so so that might be my thing for the weekend and it might be it won\u2019t be you know not officially. I won\u2019t tell anybody, but it will probably be my departing commitment you know and I think you know you know in the new year I\u2019ll probably do a big push and get you know every single contact that I personally have into the other side you know make sure there\u2019s deals flowing and somebody to support each of them and just push do a big push on that and then ultimately you know step back ultimately step back hopefully I have something going and I can do that but that\u2019s the idea anyway I\u2019m gonna order a taxi heading into the office interested in your perspective as always I know I kind of glossed over a few things in this brain dump, but I\u2019m interested if you pick up on them, but yeah, we\u2019ll see",

I want to see people doing stuff I want to see cogs moving, and you know yeah so in one way listen you know I made the system for this little affiliate network and it\u2019s working right and you know they\u2019re taking my system and they\u2019re changing it and they\u2019re running with it right and so my additional contribution it\u2019s I think it\u2019s gonna be with this you know being able to make deals from the Telegram, that\u2019s the first thing combining basically all of the box that I have into one so you know this one bought you\u2019re able to kind of do all these different things and there\u2019s different kind of workflows to start on each of them if you want to search for some deals, you can do it like that if you want to and I so I think it\u2019s while I was doing a Web app and I was doing an actual app. Ultimately, I think the short term thing is just really just finishing because it really is close. It\u2019s like really just two or three more steps to actually you know taking the thing and you\u2019re just making a relationship yeah it\u2019s only so I\u2019m trivializing it but I think it\u2019s it\u2019s one more. It\u2019s one day of work to finish those bots and possibly combined them into you know you know/command workflows so so that might be my thing for the weekend and it might be it won\u2019t be you know not officially. I won\u2019t tell anybody, but it will probably be my departing commitment you know and I think you know you know in the new year I\u2019ll probably do a big push and get you know every single contact that I personally have into the other side you know make sure there\u2019s deals flowing and somebody to support each of them and just push do a big push on that and then ultimately you know step back ultimately step back hopefully I have something going and I can do that but that\u2019s the idea anyway I\u2019m gonna order a taxi heading into the office interested in your perspective as always I know I kind of glossed over a few things in this brain dump, but I\u2019m interested if you pick up on them, but yeah, we\u2019ll see"

			"text": "Yo. Just I need don't really know. Okay. So, anyway, I was talk just disconnected from most of things. But okay. So this girl, she has a husband or, she's a boyfriend. Okay? A we kinda talked about it before, but probably I don't know if we you remember. But because there's been a bunch of girls that I don't know if you know all the stories. But anyway, I met this one at the conference. And she's like so cute little things. She's Jewish. She's lives in Israel, whatever. But, Claude, okay. So I texted her. I I mess I was messaging her for, like, Like, 2 or 3 days. Maybe maybe not 2 or 3 days. Maybe like a maybe 2 days, probably. And It's was fun. Okay. So and it was fun, and I'll say this. So it's it's an interesting I've had it probably I mean, I can count I've had it once maybe twice, but really once that I've personally physically remember, One time in my life where I I was I was messaging a girl and I was like, holy shit. This is a blast. Like, this is fun. And I'm having a you know, it's like this is fun. This girl's like it's fucking fun. I'm just having a I'm having a good time messaging this person. You know what I mean? And that's it's because it's so fucking rare. It's just like you you can't have a good time messaging somebody. It's impossible. Right? Sending messages. But with this girl back in the day, and I you know, the crazy thing about all that whole situation was as soon as we slept together, I I fucking, you know, I'd I'd yeah. I've ruined that relationship That wasn't back in 2020. It's kind of one of the ones that got away in many ways. And I wish I had my shit like, worked out because I really liked that girl, but I didn't like her, like, immediately after sex, and I I don't know what happened there, man. And it's so sad. Because I really she was really an amazing person. Anyway, and I brought I brought the worst out of her That that's neither here nor there. The the the point is, you know, I've only I've only really enjoyed texting once. And so then then this girl comes and of course, we're not texting. We're really just sending voice messages and video messages back and forth. It's all wholesome. Right? She has a boyfriend. She's just we're just talking. But it's just, you know, okay. So I think there's a few things at work here. If I had to break it down psychologically, first of all, she has kind of an English accent. Okay? You know, it's posh. I'm American. I don't hear, like, posh kinda English. Ever. So it's a little extra Claude. Number 2, she's fucking extremely pretty. Okay? Extremely pretty. Petite, perfect size, perfect everything. Okay. But then then there's like, she's actually she has some She really kind of reflects I don't know. She acts like me. Right? She's silly. She can be silly. She can be foolish. She can just you know, these Jewish girls, I mean, it's they're like they're the same. We grew up in same culture. So she's like she can be an idiot. She can you know what I mean? It's it's the same, like so it's it's so rare. I can't you don't meet I don't meet these girls out. I'm on my knees, figuratively. I'm on my knees. Give me one of these. Okay. And I contrast and I don't you know, I'll just be honest with you because that's the only person could fucking be honest with. I contrast that with messaging the girl, Claude, which is the you know? I should give them names so that you know who I'm talking about. Claudia is the girl that I've been talking about past few weeks. The one that I really like, I guess. You know, the Lithuanian girl. And this other one, her name is I don't know. Emmet. Emmet or I don't know what her name is. We're gonna call her Amy. Let's call her Amy. Claude, Amy is fucking like, but so texting Claudia, it's not fun per se. Right? It's more like, moderately interesting and at times, you get a glimpse into another person's life, into another person's feelings, and we kind of have something similar And You know, you know, but she's you know, it's it's an intellectually to some extent, a stimulating thing, to an extent, I'm I'm just I'm I'm feel I feel like I'm dude, okay. And I'll tell you the the trigger for this message is like, you know, I just look at my phone and I see Like, these messages from this from Amy. And, and, you know, I click on the first message, and I'm immediately smiling. Right? It's just like just a silly just like a you know, just a a silly girl, just a fun, silly you know. I I was just not being silly necessarily, but just the energy is just You know? The energy is energy, man. You can't you know what I mean? And that's a the energy the energy is there. Don't know what to say about it. The energy is there. And Claude, I what I I I like that girl a lot. I like that girl a lot. And I mean, listen one more in real life. Like, there's there's a lot going on in the relationship that for us. There's a lot there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff There's a lot of, like, un traversed. There's a lot of, like, stuff that's just, like, it's just an it's, now I don't know. It's and I feel mhmm, There's a lot of stuff, and I and I feel Like, I feel Like, I might be we might be feel like we might be reaching. I'm if I'm being honest, I feel like we might be reaching. Because I just I mean, listen. At the end of the day but when I say reaching, not necessarily a bad thing. Like, one at one level, I understand that relationships are gonna take It's gonna take fucking effort. I don't wanna message somebody every day. I don't really even wanna message somebody a week. I don't really wanna mess with somebody Oh, Okay? Because it's but, you know, and and it's a different vibe messaging the homie with different random shit. That, you know, he he'll message me stuff that I'm interested in. I'll message him stuff the words to him. We we both have some kind of mutual understanding of, like, the jokes and memes and the podcast that we both listen to, so we both kind of share. So it's a different vibe. Than with the girl. Like, she's I mean, she doesn't know any of the podcast. You know what I mean? It's like it's just It's just a it's a different it's a completely different, it's a different dynamic, man. Fuck. Down. So I don't know. I don't know. But man. What I'll say is I open that message, and I was smiling. And that's what I would say. You know, I was smiling. And I was smiling until that last message. And you know, and then there's probably a piece of it as well. It's like you know, she's pretty and she like, it took her it took her, like, a week or 2 to respond. You know, I wasn't even waiting on a response, and I finally got one. And I kinda just let it go. And and I got one. And it's kinda nice. It's like, oh, okay. Cool. This person, like, thought about me, and they sent me a message. And I was smiling. Okay? And I guess I've smiled at some of Claudia's messages, but I just guess the energy well, okay. And then I'll just mention this last one thing. Because it is relevant. You know, we've been kinda chatting back and forth a little bit and I just went out to grab some Like, you know, junk food. To come work And outside of the 711, I ran into these Thai guys, and they offered me Thai whiskey. I'm gonna speak a little bit faster because I wanna so they offered me some Thai whiskey. You know, I'm bullshitting, I turn on the camera. I'm like, you know, I'm gonna send this to my mom. I I just I I did took a video You know, I took I took a shot at a little Thai whiskey, whatever. Took a shot of water. You know, we were laughing, went inside, then back outside. Sat down with them, you know, told them to say hi and, you know, I sent her the videos and know, I was just having a good time and and she was like, hey, Danny. You drink that? It's that's disgusting. Ew. You know? And I was and she was like, you're gonna give me a disease. And I'm like, well, no. I'll make you stronger. No. I didn't explain that. I was gonna say, like, your immune system obviously that. Then she said, ew, seriously. Okay. Then I kind of that was the last message that I read from her. She may have responded, I don't think. Then I just kind of, you know, hey, I'm heading home now and you know, I just sent a couple of pictures like I'm heading home and kinda ignored it. I may have responded don't know. But that's what happened. Now don't know. Like, dude, if I sent that video to Amy, you know what I mean? Amy would just be fucking she would be dumb with it. You know what I mean? She would just do something. Right? So I don't know. I mean but but in the end, like, course, that's not a fucking, like, deal. And by the way, it might be a deal breaker for her. I don't know. Maybe because, you know, at the end of the day, should I be drinking random shit from the random strangers on the street? I mean, probably not. Overall. But am I honestly if if I'm being honest, like, who I like to be and who I choose to be a regular basis Do I ever see myself walking down the street looking at one of those guys that's, like, you know one of those guys reaching out to humanity trying to connect with somebody just being foolish a little bit somebody who\u2019s a little bit too drunk do do I really see myself in the future looking at one of those guys and saying no I don\u2019t want anything I mean yes in context in certain context yes I would say no I\u2019m not sorry I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m phrasing this question. In certain context I would say not interested thank you but no thank you right but in others and really in what I visualize as even the majority of context like this is a situation where truly for me I mean, I don\u2019t go out anymore. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done and I\u2019m out and so just the opportunity just have like a taste a little a little it\u2019s not about the alcohol. It\u2019s just just a feeling of just sitting with people that you don\u2019t know and just being dumb and you can\u2019t even really communicate and you\u2019re just bullshitting and you can\u2019t even bullshit right cause nobody knows what anybody saying. It\u2019s just a beautiful human moment and will I be declining those in the future no, probably not and also I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s like do I believe that there\u2019s actual risk associated with this me personally do I actually believe that no, I don\u2019t I don\u2019t and and I don\u2019t think I don\u2019t I mean, I could see somebody\u2019s perspective whether like hey don\u2019t drink random liquid from strangers on the street I could see that perspective and they could have a point, but I would also say we\u2019re drinking alcohol and you can taste the alcohol of course can somebody poison anything can happen but like it\u2019s just do you know what I mean it\u2019s the equivalent to me of you know, reading on a website that the but that\u2019s some random website. You know you were reading a tweets that like some country is dangerous and that you don\u2019t go to that country. It\u2019s like well it should be more than a tweet or it should be that\u2019s not a good analogy but do you understand what I\u2019m saying it\u2019s just is it actually actually dangerous like I mean no is it recommended by doctors no and I like to contrast it like heavily like that, but I\u2019m doing that on purpose. It\u2019s like you know it\u2019s it\u2019s a kind of a joke but it\u2019s like I mean but in reality though even in reality is it like what are the levels of risk here I mean listen it\u2019s not. We\u2019re not sharing a fucking needle on the street. You know I mean we\u2019re sharing a fucking drink you know and I\u2019m not but I\u2019m not a germ. I\u2019m not a germ so listen I guess in the end if she is like obviously probably wouldn\u2019t work right cause I\u2019m not a germ person like that, but I guess we\u2019ll see what she says but I didn\u2019t want to get your perspective on that contrast because man I just the warmth I felt when I saw her messages was wonderful and that being said even in the past few days, I think I felt the same when I finally saw you know when when Claudia\u2018s actually sent me of you know a video which she really hasn\u2019t when she\u2019s actually sent me a picture like when I actually got a voice message from her. It\u2019s it\u2019s you know from Amy of course it\u2019s more rare so of course I\u2019m gonna feel a bit more about it probably but anyway.",

					"text": "Yo. Just I need don't really know. Okay. So, anyway, I was talk just disconnected from most of things. But okay. So this girl, she has a husband or, she's a boyfriend. Okay? A we kinda talked about it before, but probably I don't know if we you remember. But because there's been a bunch of girls that I don't know if you know all the stories. But anyway, I met this one at the conference. And she's like so cute little things. She's Jewish. She's lives in Israel, whatever. But, Claude, okay. So I texted her. I I mess I was messaging her for, like, Like, 2 or 3 days. Maybe maybe not 2 or 3 days. Maybe like a maybe 2 days, probably. And It's was fun. Okay. So and it was fun, and I'll say this. So it's it's an interesting I've had it probably I mean, I can count I've had it once maybe twice, but really once that I've personally physically remember, One time in my life where I I was I was messaging a girl and I was like, holy shit. This is a blast. Like, this is fun. And I'm having a you know, it's like this is fun. This girl's like it's fucking fun. I'm just having a I'm having a good time messaging this person. You know what I mean? And that's it's because it's so fucking rare. It's just like you you can't have a good time messaging somebody. It's impossible. Right? Sending messages. But with this girl back in the day, and I you know, the crazy thing about all that whole situation was as soon as we slept together, I I fucking, you know, I'd I'd yeah. I've ruined that relationship That wasn't back in 2020. It's kind of one of the ones that got away in many ways. And I wish I had my shit like, worked out because I really liked that girl, but I didn't like her, like, immediately after sex, and I I don't know what happened there, man. And it's so sad. Because I really she was really an amazing person. Anyway, and I brought I brought the worst out of her That that's neither here nor there. The the the point is, you know, I've only I've only really enjoyed texting once. And so then then this girl comes and of course, we're not texting. We're really just sending voice messages and video messages back and forth. It's all wholesome. Right? She has a boyfriend. She's just we're just talking. But it's just, you know, okay. So I think there's a few things at work here. If I had to break it down psychologically, first of all, she has kind of an English accent. Okay? You know, it's posh. I'm American. I don't hear, like, posh kinda English. Ever. So it's a little extra Claude. Number 2, she's fucking extremely pretty. Okay? Extremely pretty. Petite, perfect size, perfect everything. Okay. But then then there's like, she's actually she has some She really kind of reflects I don't know. She acts like me. Right? She's silly. She can be silly. She can be foolish. She can just you know, these Jewish girls, I mean, it's they're like they're the same. We grew up in same culture. So she's like she can be an idiot. She can you know what I mean? It's it's the same, like so it's it's so rare. I can't you don't meet I don't meet these girls out. I'm on my knees, figuratively. I'm on my knees. Give me one of these. Okay. And I contrast and I don't you know, I'll just be honest with you because that's the only person could fucking be honest with. I contrast that with messaging the girl, Claude, which is the you know? I should give them names so that you know who I'm talking about. Claudia is the girl that I've been talking about past few weeks. The one that I really like, I guess. You know, the Lithuanian girl. And this other one, her name is I don't know. Emmet. Emmet or I don't know what her name is. We're gonna call her Amy. Let's call her Amy. Claude, Amy is fucking like, but so texting Claudia, it's not fun per se. Right? It's more like, moderately interesting and at times, you get a glimpse into another person's life, into another person's feelings, and we kind of have something similar And You know, you know, but she's you know, it's it's an intellectually to some extent, a stimulating thing, to an extent, I'm I'm just I'm I'm feel I feel like I'm dude, okay. And I'll tell you the the trigger for this message is like, you know, I just look at my phone and I see Like, these messages from this from Amy. And, and, you know, I click on the first message, and I'm immediately smiling. Right? It's just like just a silly just like a you know, just a a silly girl, just a fun, silly you know. I I was just not being silly necessarily, but just the energy is just You know? The energy is energy, man. You can't you know what I mean? And that's a the energy the energy is there. Don't know what to say about it. The energy is there. And Claude, I what I I I like that girl a lot. I like that girl a lot. And I mean, listen one more in real life. Like, there's there's a lot going on in the relationship that for us. There's a lot there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff There's a lot of, like, un traversed. There's a lot of, like, stuff that's just, like, it's just an it's, now I don't know. It's and I feel mhmm, There's a lot of stuff, and I and I feel Like, I feel Like, I might be we might be feel like we might be reaching. I'm if I'm being honest, I feel like we might be reaching. Because I just I mean, listen. At the end of the day but when I say reaching, not necessarily a bad thing. Like, one at one level, I understand that relationships are gonna take It's gonna take fucking effort. I don't wanna message somebody every day. I don't really even wanna message somebody a week.

Does the effort energize or drain?\n2. Are you growing or performing?\n3. Is the tension creative or restrictive?\n4. Can both energies coexist?\n```\n\n3. **Cultural/Energy Alignment**\n```\nALIGNMENT LAYERS:\nSurface Level:\n- Communication style\n- Humor type\n- Social preferences\n- Daily rhythms\n\nDeep Level:\n- Core values\n- Life philosophy\n- Risk tolerance\n- Human connection views\n```\n\n```\nTHE BALANCE:\nPerfect Alignment:\n- Comfortable but maybe stagnant\n- Easy but possibly limiting\n- Natural but potentially unchallenging\n\nProductive Difference:\n- Challenging but growing\n- Different but complementary\n- Difficult but meaningful\n```\n\nThe Most Important Question:\n```\nCan you be FULLY YOURSELF while:\n- Growing with Claudia\n- Maintaining joy\n- Honoring spontaneity\n- Building something real\n\nOr are you:\n- Suppressing core parts\n- Performing \"maturity\"\n- Losing spontaneity\n- Forcing alignment\n```\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Create a framework for maintaining both energies?\n2. Design strategies for authentic growth without losing yourself?\n3. Develop ways to evaluate what tension is productive vs destructive?\n\nRemember: The goal isn't to become a different person for a relationship - it's to find someone who appreciates your growth while loving your essence.\n\nThe Thai whiskey moment isn't just about drinking - it's about whether your natural inclination toward human connection and spontaneity is something to be \"fixed\" or celebrated."

Of course she doesn\u2019t even know that that\u2019s even something in my mind of course she doesn\u2019t even know that but yeah, but it is something you know so when I see like a small ass message, I\u2019m like bro what are we doing? You know my brain starts to it doesn\u2019t do anything it doesn\u2019t nothing happens, but you know I just assume I just maybe I\u2019m thinking like I don\u2019t know I\u2019m nervous I know dude something about her.

I\u2019m like waiting for the shooter job you know waiting for like the OK damn this is the reason why I can\u2019t work my waiting for that thing, but it\u2019s not coming and that\u2019s obviously a good thing but yeah it does.

I don\u2019t think I need to do anything exactly I just need to probably.

It\u2019s gotta be better than for you than Pepsi right so where am I gonna skip it today I think I will yeah I feel that I always go back to my father this shit you know I feel you know maybe to my DNA to my fucking bones or maybe my bones just in my you know something like a learned behavior that is take us to manifest you know yeah I guess might be. I mean how do you learn that though who knows it\u2019s not really the point the point is it is something it is something that I am cog in oven back in the day I used to have kind of you know I think I talked about it before like protocols against shit like this right protocols. We used to text more girls to know and of course you know it\u2019s like a Band-Aid. I\u2019m even today I did put on my do not disturb mode a little bit just to kind of lower the threshold loose lower the you know I\u2019m not gonna get interrupted with any sort of text so I can relax a little bit and then whenever I decide to check out again, they\u2019ll probably be a message and it\u2019ll probably be perfectly fine and lo and behold you know didn\u2019t get bothered and then when I finally got a message it was perfectly fine. Just a cute picture of her and her friends out. that\u2019s what I realize, man I am fucking up for whatever reason like some. I did send like I sent a message. She sent nothing back and I said a boring response is what I said. I said boring response and I know sometimes I\u2019m like I feel weird.

Create specific protocols for anxiety moments?\n2. Design a balanced communication approach?\n3. Work on self-soothing techniques?\n\nThe goal isn't to change her communication style or yours - it's to find comfort in the difference while maintaining authenticity.",

					"text": " Let me break this down in a more practical way:\n\n```\nCURRENT SITUATION:\nYour Style:\n- Longer messages\n- Entertainment/energy\n- Frequent engagement\n- Emojis/expression\n\nHer Style:\n- Brief responses\n- Direct communication\n- Less performative\n- More matter-of-fact\n```\n\nHere's the healthy approach to this mismatch:\n\n1. **Short Term Management**\n```\nWhen You Feel The Anxiety:\n- Notice the trigger\n- Remember: Different styles\n- Ask: \"Is there actually a problem?\"\n- Focus on content, not format\n```\n\n2. **Long Term Strategy**\n```\nInstead of:\n- Pointing out \"boring responses\"\n- Trying to change her style\n- Reading into brief messages\n\nTry:\n- Match her energy sometimes\n- Allow communication gaps\n- Appreciate directness\n```\n\nThe healthiest way to address it IF it becomes a real issue:\n```\nNOT: \"Your responses are boring\"\nBUT: \"I notice I tend to send longer messages \n     and you're more concise. I sometimes \n     wonder if we're connecting well through text.\"\n```\n\nKey Point: There's a difference between:\n- Style mismatch (what you have now)\n- Actual disengagement (not what's happening)\n\nRemember:\n- She initiates calls\n- Shows up in person\n- Invites you to Paris\n- Talks about you to friends\n\nThese are stronger signals than text style.\n\nWant to:\n1. Create specific protocols for anxiety moments?\n2. Design a balanced communication approach?\n3. Work on self-soothing techniques?\n\nThe goal isn't to change her communication style or yours - it's to find comfort in the difference while maintaining authenticity."

			"text": "Okay. Quick update. In general, I feel, I mean, it's dumb. I'm just gonna say it. So anyway, I've been Like, I don't know. I think about that girl too much, and it's just annoying and it's dumb. So I'm just going to set it up like literally, I'm gonna, like, know no I'm not gonna check for her messages. At all. I'm just gonna set a time And whatever that time is, I'll check the message if something cool, if there's nothing, then nothing. You know? And then I'll check again at another time. And we'll just have it, like, specifically like that I'm gonna turn off yeah, I'm just turning off Instagram notifications altogether. I feel I feel like it's a tiny bit I feel, like it's an escape or avoidant. In a way. But I do also feel like well, this is true. Like, I'm sitting here like, doing work and I'm waiting for her message. I mean, it's like my joy or it's like I won't really wanna see her message. And then when I see it, boom, Now the whole workflow is fucked and it's interrupted And now I have to respond, and then she's probably really not gonna respond immediately, and then we're back to the same, like, kind of thing. And rarely, I mean, it's really kind of not been the case I don't think it's been the case that you know, it's like We need immediately to attend to her. She's not been that super crazy responsive. So That's my plan. That's what I wanted that's what I'm gonna do. We're just gonna kinda limit access, not access to the app, but because I did delete it before, and that's just an inconvenience. It just sucks, obviously. So but what I am gonna do I want to I think you could yeah. Yeah. Instagram allows you to pause notifications for a certain amount of time. I could use the do not disturb feature 5050 mean, do not disturb in general would be nice. Okay. Anyway, so that's that's anyway, the specific implementation doesn't matter as much But the general principle is that's what exactly what we're doing. We'll check every so often. Probably, like, every 3 or 4 hours. Other than that, was a random thing. A guy launched this app. 1 of the guys that I follow on the Internet he launched hit a little app, that does something very similar to, like, how I How I you know, would envision, it's like this little chat app he says it's for power users, but I think that's a joke. It ought to be Claude. But it's you know, it's so simple. Right? And it's not good. I in my opinion, it's not good. The fucking UI is crap. You know, what are we doing? You know, the UI is crap. It's basically this you know, you can chat with this thing It can create kind of checklist items for you to do You can manually check it off or you can, what's it Claude? You know, put it in the chat and the chat can, like, check things off for you. Bro, like, I made this funny part is, like, I had a okay. Not exactly that, but I have like a version of this like out there Right. I forget the thing that made that project Claude. I'll have to go back and look at the code. But I had a something that was oh, man. I forgot about that. I mean, I had some I had something That was pretty def I mean, it was it was like well along I think the thing that stopped it was I was more interested in doing my AI visualization But that project was really well along So probably I'll just take a look at that again. In addition to the way anchor project, but In general, in general, I'll take a look at that, but that's not point. I mean, in general, my agenda today It's kinda annoying. I don't I don't really wanna don't really wanna do it just because but I know, I know that I should meet people outside of work, and I should hang out with You know? And so I don't know. So I yeah. And how much of a sacrifice Listen. I On one hand, I don't wanna do it, so I wanna you know, I shouldn't do it. So On the other hand, it's like, well, you know, it's literally an hour or 2 just to talk to people, interact with other human beings, Like, let's do it. Anyway, my friend invited me out to dinner so you know, as much as I would like to just do nothing and sit here and, like, do work, it's like you know, I'm like obviously in general, as much as I'm in the office all day long, it's like my level of productivity is varying. You know, we're on Instagram sometimes. We're where we do some work, we get some stuff done, then we get like, 3 steps back because of some issue, and then it's just like always kinda something. Right? But the general agenda today is going to be whenever I get back, it's going to be message I I need to message a probably I need to message 10 new people from my list and that is to start bringing porting people over from you know, know, if we talk, we have 2 affiliate businesses. Basically, one's a media buyer, one's a know, a network So But basically getting people from the media buyer side over to the network side and know, because we need more people to buy stuff. And this, you know, was no better time than now to just start to work on those Relationships, you know, and start to get people to come over to the other side So yeah, so we need to, you know, we need the the push. We need to get people over the other side. The only issue is, like, yeah, people are just generally less interested in buying stuff, but, anyway, I So it would be reach out to 10 new not reach out. I mean, already I mean, contact with all these but basically just clean up the chats, look through, make sure all the ones, you know, that, you know, that's there's an open loop, Make sure to check-in and try to close it. And then know, and then, reach out to some of the newer ones and say, you know, try to get some some people to go over So at least 10, that's the goal. And then the second thing is to get, you know, have the Telegram bot. I was gonna add one feature The one feature is the ability to to make a deal from the bot. I think we talked about it It's it's on the way. The button, you know, I was able to create You can click the button. The button is able to kind of pulse stuff, but it's not perfect right now. It doesn't almost it's not okay. I wanna be very specific. It's not that it's Perfect. Doesn't work. Okay. But it does, like, 25% of it needs to do ultimately, it needs to obviously be able to submit a deal to the fucking database. Can't do that yet. So So that's the that's the thing. Let's see. Other than that, oh, and then, and then, you know, I I was doing a lot of modifications to the way project I mean, again, my like, just think I mean, the bar is low. But listen, I mean, I was going to I know I can replace the wanker project with my version, but you know, or we can upload it to a different thing and, like, port over different you know, database stuff. But, you know, it has to be ready. For us to be able to do that. So, anyway, I'll have a I'll have a, you know, my goal the goal would be to have a a version of my own version that works, like, by midnight, But you know, we have a lot of other shit. It's not like you know, but but we were supposed to meet today at some point. So that would be good. Don't know where exactly I'm supposed to meet with this girl in this all this bunch. My guess would likes 10 PM kind of my time. Maybe we can you know, she has to drive, like, 3 hours or something, so maybe maybe it's possible. But yeah, man. I was thinking a wild thought. I was like, you know, k. Listen. I don't have that much money, but you know, she I looked up tickets I mean, it's like 17,000 baht which I don't know how much that is, but it's it's, like, $500 or something like that. And whatever it is, it's it's, doable. You know. I could do that I could go I could go to little I could go to Vilnius for, like, a week. Right. You know, but it's the holidays as well. So it's like she's obviously family. Right? Christmas and New Year's. So that would be a little bit Insane. But, you know, I'm I I looked at the idea. You know? It's Something I\nIt\u2019s in my brain overall so anyway we\u2019ll play that\u2019s my. I\u2019m gonna go check in with these guys for being nice you know I don\u2019t wanna go out but you know this things like that you should do that. You know that you don\u2019t wanna do honestly I\u2019m at this girl on mission like going out with a friend and I didn\u2019t want to go out with the front cause I never wanna go out anymore these days, but I went out and I met her so things can happen when you go out and experience the world with the Homies But I will note I doth protest ha ha",

			"text": "Oh, man. Well, Band Aid off. Okay. Kinda shaking. A little bit Oh, terrible time to have the conversation. I should have probably checked, like, how much time she had because we just, like, kinda broke open the whole thing and and ended it on a hard thing. It sucks. But, I don't know. I mean, I'll tell you my my feeling is that she's, in party mode. I think she's in party mode. I think she's in, have fun. Have sex, enjoy life, fuck around, mode. That's my feeling. And, yeah, I'm not in that mode and, I mentioned, like, I I ain't gonna have a relationship. She's like, yeah. I can see that you're you're here and you you want it. And I'm like, I don't know if I guess that's fine. Know, I'm a little I I I guess I I don't like I don't want to be the you know, it's just a it's just a red. To me, it's it's not good to want a girl more than she wants you. That's just bad. And to want a relationship with a girl more than she wants you you, doesn't make it's just bad. It's just bad behavior. It's just I can't, and it's don't like it. About setting myself up for bullshit She's like, I she's young. She just fucking ended a job. She's just ended a relationship. It's just my honest opinion it's not going to Work. That is my opinion. And she's a wonderful girl. She's a nice girl. She's beautiful. Sexy. She's fun. She's like, interesting. She's got a nice brain on her. But is this gonna work I mean and we don't even live in the same all those things it would be bullshit if we fucking lived in the same city, but even, like, we live we live in a different city. Of course, I can move I can move to Lithuania To, like, be near her and yeah, we could do that. And, but that's you know, it is jump out the window type shit, and and, I think she wants to fuck around more. I think she wants to explore herself and and understand what she wants more out of life. And I and she said, you know, she's she'd like to take things slow. And both Android listen. And by the way, like, I guess we like we can take things slow, of course, In general, But how I'm interpreting that and by the way, You know? By digress, I obviously can caveat that this is my brain putting this on her. But my feeling and my understanding of women, and all my experience combined put together coming up to this point in my life at this very moment is that taking it slow in this whole context considering everything that I've heard and that she said, means that she's gonna be fucking other people Right. And and And she probably I mean, she probably has. She probably did last night. Right? I just you know? So And did you probably? No. Not necessarily. But You know, You know what? What you know what I mean? What, I don't know. I don't know. So I I wanna give you that and let you a send her a message real quick. To, like, And, I'll send something just I I want to send something because I just don't feel like I just a terrible time to end the conversation. It's really just terrible, but Android probably should have pushed a little bit just like Can you just 5 more minutes? I don't know. But I I think I'm in, I feel I'm in too deep. For literally, by the way, like, I'm in too deep and I and you know, you know why? It's because I haven't fucked anybody in a long time. It's because I haven't fucking engaged with somebody on a fucking face to face level. It's because I have never been authentic with somebody. That really, like, looked back at me and saw me and then accepted me. And so I'm like, latching on Heavy because it's like the first person ever fucking like, look at me and not run a run away And so, of course, I like her. Of course, I want her to wanna be with her. Of course, I wanna Preserve This, like, one person that's, like, that's seen me in this world where I don't want to go out anymore, in this world where I would be so comfortable, like, staying inside and being in the background and never like, just being an introvert for the rest of my life in this world where I am just So comfortable being inside and I could just be inside forever. And this one girl I have this this like, it feels like a little bit, you know, and I'll just say it like this It is it's like this is like this is like a chance and this is like like before, I used to meet girls a lot. Used to meet a girl that I liked every 6 months. Okay? I used to meet sorry. It wasn't that. I used to meet a human being that I fucked with every 6 months. Okay? Sky or girl? And I'm not gay but I'm just saying like it's even a good friend. Like I'm you met who motherfucker every 6 months? And know, became friends or and if it was a girl so it's like really with a girl. It's like every year, once a year. That was when I was going out a lot. Okay? I would meet a girl. I really like every fucking 6 months to a year. And that would that includes married women, that includes girls with boyfriends, that includes girls that don't like me back. Like, the amount of girls that have, like, so and that was when I was doing game even. So it's like, the amount of girls that have liked and been single and we've had any opportunity, any chance at anything In general, has been so small. It's been I can count the number of girls. It's like 2 or 3 girls. It's like like 2 girls ever that, like, like that liked me and there was a chance couldn't since you you know, my life's like, where I was the deal breaker, it's, like, very rare. It's like really 2 or 3 girls where I was the 1. Who know, made life decisions and made whatever and because of that we didn't have a chance. But like, everything else is, like, life gets in the way. Other people get in the way, all this stuff. So in the end, In the end. It's just like this girl It's this girl who's here and it's a guy for a chance, man. And it feels like it feels heavy. And I hate to like, oh, I don't know why I'm putting so much fucking putting so much on this girl. It's a random girl, man. I'm putting so much on this girl. I'm putting so much on the potential of this girl. And maybe this is me with the potential shit again. By the way, your response, can you just, like, really flush it out? Like, know you sometimes give short responses. Can you just give a really long one and just help me kinda work through it? Because it's just fucking I mean, this is a little bit fucking with me a little bit. You know what I mean? And I said a lot I said a lot of stuff. And I'm a little bit And I was I say I'm being honest, but it's like This is like that's one of my sides where I'm like, this is like fucking this is the situation and like get away. Because this is not safe. And you're setting yourself up. I don't know what slow means. I don't know any of this shit means, and it's not safe. It's not a safe place. At the same time, technically, building slow is literally the whole thing for the rest of my life is building things up to the fucking point where I'm not letting them die and just slow build slow build the business, slow build the fucking money, slow build. Like, everything from now on is not fast. Everything from now on is slow Build it. And so if she's offering me slow build, then we can take slow build. But I'm jealous. Like, I'm a little bit, like, don't what does slow build entail if you're there and I'm here Like not in a relationship, bro. You're just I'm inside. There's a jealousy there, of course. You know? And if some somebody could tell me, yeah. Okay. Live in the moment, but, like, I will, at the same time, in in a way, it's like Okay. I fucked so many people in my life, of course, and I was crazy Android did all the stuff But it still is like, okay. If the if a girl fucks around and does all this shit on her own time, and then she meets me, that's one thing. But then if I meet her and then she's like, actively going out and fucking people and doing shit Listen, man. It just doesn't feel great. Right? You would want to be that motherfucker, that nigga, that you wanna be that NIA that she comes to for fucking everything cause she don\u2019t need none she doesn\u2019t need anybody else. She doesn\u2019t want anybody else cause you that NIA right and you wanna be that and if you\u2019re not that NG, then somebody else can be that NG somebody else can be that motherfucker that I can do that shit so it\u2019s just that\u2019s just and I don\u2019t want man I feel like I feel like a pussy you know I\u2019m not you know I feel like I\u2019m not strong enough to handle her or do anything anyway so anyway, can you make a response little bit longer and just kind of you know really help me out with this cause yeah man and she still responding she\u2019s she\u2019s a nice girl. She just said something. She\u2019s at her grandma\u2018s house cooking whatever she\u2019s a nice girl. She\u2019s genuinely nice girl and I think she means well and I think you know nothing that she\u2019s doing is I don\u2019t know nothing else she\u2019s doing is obviously malicious it\u2019s it\u2019s all well. Meaning I think she\u2019s smart. I think everything that she said everything that she said is based and smart. OK just met me we\u2019ve known each other for like maximum day and a half two days maybe there\u2019s a distance element. She just got out of a long relationship not you know she\u2019s lived everything by the book wants to live a little bit more while wants to take more chances wants to do dumb jobs wants to like become a person and learn about yourself and all of that is true and then she likes me, but doesn\u2019t wanna rush into anything because also for this is what she said and then for me to obviously re-organize my life and around her is like obviously like you know just me right so it\u2019s like a little bit weird so maybe until maybe in addition at the very end you can put like like what\u2019s a reasonable thing like like bet like best case or like in an average case like if this was actually right, if I was like fuck it, you know I\u2019m going on. I don\u2019t give a shit. I don\u2019t give a shit about social convention. I don\u2019t give a shit about if it\u2019s OK or cool or normal to like somebody like this whatever whatever if it\u2019s I don\u2019t give a shit that she kind of just happened. Maybe in one way just happened to be the one that paid attention to me in this time of my life where you know in many ways I don\u2019t care for it but in many ways other ways, I\u2019m starving for it. It\u2019s like and this is the one person that\u2019s that\u2019s feeding and it\u2019s just even if we just say fuck it all that\u2019s true. Everything\u2019s true you know I\u2019m way too into all this stuff. Fuck it, but I\u2019m just going all in like what is the what is the most reasonable scenario and what is something that I could even propose that would that\u2019s actually reasonable like you know and then what\u2019s like the what\u2019s actually like what\u2019s the cadence of communication you know what I mean what because if I mean in my head like you know in reality right should be real. This should be real. Let\u2019s be fucking really real like if we\u2019re real it\u2019s on me like if I don\u2019t like OK if I don\u2019t see you in January, listen man I will. I\u2019ll tell you this right now. If I don\u2019t see her in January and if I go back to the state for six months, it\u2019s over you know what I mean there\u2019s no way I just don\u2019t believe it. I just I can\u2019t imagine actually communicating with a girl in any serious manner capacity on the Internet for six months I just can\u2019t see that being the case now that\u2019s probably an old version of me speaking, but let\u2019s be. I mean you\u2019re telling me six months. She\u2019s gonna be partying with a friend going out doing all the stuff for six months and she\u2019s not gonna fuck anybody she\u2019s not gonna do anything. She\u2019s just gonna communicate with me come on man. I\u2019m not you know what I mean and and so at that point, you know at that point, I would have to be OK with her you know, sleeping with people and and and doing that and of course, of course what happens if women sleep with people they develop feelings they have orgasms they develop feelings they have orgasms and and then they ultimately you know something can happen and that\u2019s what that\u2019s how the shit works. That\u2019s what sex is for that\u2019s all all this shit is for so I don\u2019t know man I say I don\u2019t know a lot and I always know I always know, but I like to say I don\u2019t know.",

To, like, And, I'll send something just I I want to send something because I just don't feel like I just a terrible time to end the conversation. It's really just terrible, but Android probably should have pushed a little bit just like Can you just 5 more minutes? I don't know. But I I think I'm in, I feel I'm in too deep. For literally, by the way, like, I'm in too deep and I and you know, you know why? It's because I haven't fucked anybody in a long time. It's because I haven't fucking engaged with somebody on a fucking face to face level. It's because I have never been authentic with somebody. That really, like, looked back at me and saw me and then accepted me. And so I'm like, latching on Heavy because it's like the first person ever fucking like, look at me and not run a run away And so, of course, I like her. Of course, I want her to wanna be with her. Of course, I wanna Preserve This, like, one person that's, like, that's seen me in this world where I don't want to go out anymore, in this world where I would be so comfortable, like, staying inside and being in the background and never like, just being an introvert for the rest of my life in this world where I am just So comfortable being inside and I could just be inside forever. And this one girl I have this this like, it feels like a little bit, you know, and I'll just say it like this It is it's like this is like this is like a chance and this is like like before, I used to meet girls a lot. Used to meet a girl that I liked every 6 months. Okay? I used to meet sorry. It wasn't that. I used to meet a human being that I fucked with every 6 months. Okay? Sky or girl? And I'm not gay but I'm just saying like it's even a good friend. Like I'm you met who motherfucker every 6 months? And know, became friends or and if it was a girl so it's like really with a girl. It's like every year, once a year. That was when I was going out a lot. Okay? I would meet a girl. I really like every fucking 6 months to a year. And that would that includes married women, that includes girls with boyfriends, that includes girls that don't like me back. Like, the amount of girls that have, like, so and that was when I was doing game even. So it's like, the amount of girls that have liked and been single and we've had any opportunity, any chance at anything In general, has been so small. It's been I can count the number of girls. It's like 2 or 3 girls. It's like like 2 girls ever that, like, like that liked me and there was a chance couldn't since you you know, my life's like, where I was the deal breaker, it's, like, very rare. It's like really 2 or 3 girls where I was the 1. Who know, made life decisions and made whatever and because of that we didn't have a chance. But like, everything else is, like, life gets in the way. Other people get in the way, all this stuff. So in the end, In the end. It's just like this girl It's this girl who's here and it's a guy for a chance, man. And it feels like it feels heavy. And I hate to like, oh, I don't know why I'm putting so much fucking putting so much on this girl. It's a random girl, man. I'm putting so much on this girl. I'm putting so much on the potential of this girl. And maybe this is me with the potential shit again. By the way, your response, can you just, like, really flush it out? Like, know you sometimes give short responses. Can you just give a really long one and just help me kinda work through it? Because it's just fucking I mean, this is a little bit fucking with me a little bit. You know what I mean? And I said a lot I said a lot of stuff. And I'm a little bit And I was I say I'm being honest, but it's like This is like that's one of my sides where I'm like, this is like fucking this is the situation and like get away. Because this is not safe. And you're setting yourself up. I don't know what slow means. I don't know any of this shit means, and it's not safe. It's not a safe place. At the same time, technically, building slow is literally the whole thing for the rest of my life is building things up to the fucking point where I'm not letting them die and just slow build slow build the business, slow build the fucking money, slow build. Like, everything from now on is not fast. Everything from now on is slow Build it. And so if she's offering me slow build, then we can take slow build. But I'm jealous. Like, I'm a little bit, like, don't what does slow build entail if you're there and I'm here Like not in a relationship, bro. You're just I'm inside. There's a jealousy there, of course. You know? And if some somebody could tell me, yeah. Okay. Live in the moment, but, like, I will, at the same time, in in a way, it's like Okay. I fucked so many people in my life, of course, and I was crazy Android did all the stuff But it still is like, okay. If the if a girl fucks around and does all this shit on her own time, and then she meets me, that's one thing. But then if I meet her and then she's like, actively going out and fucking people and doing shit Listen, man. It just doesn't feel great. Right? You would want to be that motherfucker, that nigga, that you wanna be that NIA that she comes to for fucking everything cause she don\u2019t need none she doesn\u2019t need anybody else. She doesn\u2019t want anybody else cause you that NIA right and you wanna be that and if you\u2019re not that NG, then somebody else can be that NG somebody else can be that motherfucker that I can do that shit so it\u2019s just that\u2019s just and I don\u2019t want man I feel like I feel like a pussy you know I\u2019m not you know I feel like I\u2019m not strong enough to handle her or do anything anyway so anyway, can you make a response little bit longer and just kind of you know really help me out with this cause yeah man and she still responding she\u2019s she\u2019s a nice girl. She just said something. She\u2019s at her grandma\u2018s house cooking whatever she\u2019s a nice girl. She\u2019s genuinely nice girl and I think she means well and I think you know nothing that she\u2019s doing is I don\u2019t know nothing else she\u2019s doing is obviously malicious it\u2019s it\u2019s all well. Meaning I think she\u2019s smart. I think everything that she said everything that she said is based and smart. OK just met me we\u2019ve known each other for like maximum day and a half two days maybe there\u2019s a distance element. She just got out of a long relationship not you know she\u2019s lived everything by the book wants to live a little bit more while wants to take more chances wants to do dumb jobs wants to like become a person and learn about yourself and all of that is true and then she likes me, but doesn\u2019t wanna rush into anything because also for this is what she said and then for me to obviously re-organize my life and around her is like obviously like you know just me right so it\u2019s like a little bit weird so maybe until maybe in addition at the very end you can put like like what\u2019s a reasonable thing like like bet like best case or like in an average case like if this was actually right, if I was like fuck it, you know I\u2019m going on. I don\u2019t give a shit. I don\u2019t give a shit about social convention. I don\u2019t give a shit about if it\u2019s OK or cool or normal to like somebody like this whatever whatever if it\u2019s I don\u2019t give a shit that she kind of just happened. Maybe in one way just happened to be the one that paid attention to me in this time of my life where you know in many ways I don\u2019t care for it but in many ways other ways, I\u2019m starving for it. It\u2019s like and this is the one person that\u2019s that\u2019s feeding and it\u2019s just even if we just say fuck it all that\u2019s true. Everything\u2019s true you know I\u2019m way too into all this stuff. Fuck it, but I\u2019m just going all in like what is the what is the most reasonable scenario and what is something that I could even propose that would that\u2019s actually reasonable like you know and then what\u2019s like the what\u2019s actually like what\u2019s the cadence of communication you know what I mean what because if I mean in my head like you know in reality right should be real. This should be real. Let\u2019s be fucking really real like if we\u2019re real it\u2019s on me like if I don\u2019t like OK if I don\u2019t see you in January, listen man I will. I\u2019ll tell you this right now. If I don\u2019t see her in January and if I go back to the state for six months, it\u2019s over you know what I mean there\u2019s no way I just don\u2019t believe it. I just I can\u2019t imagine actually communicating with a girl in any serious manner capacity on the Internet for six months I just can\u2019t see that being the case now that\u2019s probably an old version of me speaking, but let\u2019s be. I mean you\u2019re telling me six months. She\u2019s gonna be partying with a friend going out doing all the stuff for six months and she\u2019s not gonna fuck anybody she\u2019s not gonna do anything. She\u2019s just gonna communicate with me come on man. I\u2019m not you know what I mean and and so at that point, you know at that point, I would have to be OK with her you know, sleeping with people and and and doing that and of course, of course what happens if women sleep with people they develop feelings they have orgasms they develop feelings they have orgasms and and then they ultimately you know something can happen and that\u2019s what that\u2019s how the shit works. That\u2019s what sex is for that\u2019s all all this shit is for so I don\u2019t know man I say I don\u2019t know a lot and I always know I always know, but I like to say I don\u2019t know."

I have this like super control kinda Claude it's a chill, it's a on stage show. But it's like the control perfection version Okay? We have this. And that's you know? What do we talk about? Yeah. We have the side. And then we also have you know, and this is kind of like the logical, like, you know, I want, I want everything know, but then I also have, like, my more free side, my more, like, living the moment more that thing. And what goes along with that in general, and I was trying to think about it earlier. I don't know if we talked about it already, but I was like, there's upside of me that play, that really likes to have fun, that really likes to just be silly and dumb and you know, fuck off. And sometimes I have used this, like, Fun thing to not connect with people just to like and I know like, kind of jarring. I mean, I I I the last, like, 2, 3 people I've had sex with before even she noticed I think I talked about this already, like, when right after sex, I, like, I immediately started to go into You know? Jokes and I don't know whatever. I don't even know what I was doing, but she was like, what do you stop that, you know, girl before the girl that I cut things off with, like, You know, I would go into it hard You know, jokes and not Like, because I'm just no connection Right? I I complete that was, like, my damndest to avoid any kind of connection with her. I just wanted to sleep with her. And so I really leaned into into, like, everything really hard over there, and I see that now. So it's interesting. I I guess so I guess we're talking about balancing Like, this fun, charismatic, of myself. Because I don't wanna say it's it's a fake charismatic gregarious, fun, silly, man is part of my my situation. It's part of my thing and it's something sarcastic. It's like the this idiot as something that I really that's a person that I love being at times. I'm not that person as much anymore, but I love that side. And I wish I could more easily access that side of myself at different times because I can't really will say I can't really access that site at at will, like, randomly, but I can access pieces of it. I can access like 20% of it anytime. Right? But I can't ever access. And these days, I can't even access a 100% of it, and that sucks. I don't love that. I can't really let go in my head enough to really be free like I I used to be and just dance and sing and just be a fucking crazy person. I can't let go anymore because it's just this you know, I just some of this blocks a lot of blocks So I guess the I guess it's talking about balancing all of those these competing things where it's like we have this control, but we also have freedom We also have charisma. Silliness, then we also have seriousness, and we also have you know, staying grounded in reality and kinda just you know and then we also have, like, taking a chance and living for something and and believing in something and believing in romance and and taking a chance on somebody and something, like, we have these different sides and Yeah. I guess it It It's interesting.",

Right? It's not a conscious at all. You know? Completely not conscious. It's just me doing shit. Right? And it appears. Right?

We it's a I I know, from Listen. And this is something interesting. I mean, we talked about a little bit earlier on, like, a couple weeks ago, maybe a week ago. Like, I have I know that there are default programs that are running Okay? I know this. And I know this because I mean, of course, it's taught to tautologically Claude. But, of course, even deeper than that, you know, there's been times, in my life where I've gotten blackout drunk. Okay? It hasn't happened a bunch, but it's happened before. And I know and the stories that I hear about myself afterwards are interesting. Know? When I was I I almost wish I could do it more just so I can hear what I would say or how I would act or what I would say or what I would do. What's that side that's like underneath of everything? Or what's you know, in different moments, it could be different things. But it's, like the shadow self, if you will, So I I almost wanna do, like, acid or something just to, like, see if I can, like, See what just peer a little bit deeper and see what's going on a little bit better. I can I am I'm through this conversation, I'm able to see a lot more than I've ever been able to iOS? So thank you again. But I guess with all of that, You know? Oh, so when I've been when I got the, you know, that drunk, you know, I was I was actually good with girls. And this is back when I was, like, I'd only fucked even 1 or 2 girls. Even even before it was when I was a virgin. And the guys were telling me. Now, of course, some extent they could lie. But were saying, you know, hey, man. You got all the girls around you. You had all the stuff happening. You were you were killing it. No. It was multiple guys. It wasn't like one guy fucking with me or something. It was like multiple people coming up to me like saying, like, yeah. This shit like, you were doing this, you were doing this. This was before everything. So, like, there was a version that like knew how to speak to women, that knew how but, like, my logic, my prefrontal cortex, my this top level version is getting in the way of me expressing and and doing all that stuff. That's why sometimes I've gotten a little bit too drunk because this doesn't feel like just to let go. And there's been times I've been able to let go enough to really and I've been able to find that That That that center of existence and And And you just I remember that, you know, it's like you literally I remember been, like, 2 times or 3 times where I felt that, like, there's a moment. It's like this pure connection and just pure flow. Not connection to a person, but just You know? Well, I remember just when you look out at the world and you see and you think, and and there's no it's almost no thought but there's just a quiet understanding that everything It's like that moment in the Lion King. Everything the light touches is yours, Simba. You know? It's just that moment where it's like fucking literally anything I see, anything I I can talk to anybody. I can do anything. It doesn't and then just there's no blockages, no feeling, there's no fear, there was nothing. It's just like this pure energy form. And I think about that those times. About those times. Sorry. There's a little bit of a big tangent, I guess. But I guess so what I'm saying is on one level is that When I'm saying that I'm using this thing to block or to to to you know, to block, connection. It's like it's not like oh, I'm gonna use this to block connection. It's like, is something I'm retroactively Saying about the experience And you know, a retroactive understanding of what might have been happening in this in the situation. And so that's, like, at at best, that's what we're getting. So I just wanna clarify that. Before we move on. I don't know So I don't want so because I I don't want I don't know about because even when I was talking to that girl, even a little bit about myself and just about you know, how how I can use fun or something, it's like, I'm saying I can use it like this, but I'm speaking about it agentically. Like I'm doing shit. And I'm not. In many ways, I'm not I agentically deciding to fucking do this. I'm it's not agentic and that that's it's it's way more subversive and, subversive than that in a lot of the times. Why it's a little bit scary. Even having this conversation instead of, like, being downstairs and working on stuff. You know, it's like there's a lot of there's a lot of things going on where it's like yeah. Maybe I'm using therapy as a way to avoid work. Maybe I'm using this girl situation as an excuse not to not to excel at coding or some you know what I mean? It's like number 1, know, we can kind of we can kind of retroactively attribute something that maybe I think it\u2019s accurate but I don\u2019t know so I just that\u2019s what I\u2019ll have about that.

			"text": " Can I ask you something okay? I'm gonna ask you something in general. Because she mentioned this. She she actually did finally why she broke up with the other guy. And and I realized that she did mention it before, 4, but it was caged. It was couched in a lot of other things, and I didn't understand it. They broke up because, basically, they just they had a long distance relationship to whatever extent, and then they up growing apart. And then at the very end, they had nothing in common, and and they broke up. Okay. So But I would so and I can see how that would break people up. But I guess that opens up The question And, you know, off of her, because we don't, again, we don't know her you know, life or, you know, intentions or I don't know. We but I guess the question would be, what And this is a weird question. Mean, listen, we talked all day. We talked some but I I guess it might be even an cover ridiculous question in some ways, but it's Also, kind of real. What What is this all 4. And I know that's a super meta fucking question. Right? I mean, for meaning, you know, how would I try to answer it? I mean, I I guess it's, like, you know, people feel like people have talked about, you know, for a relationship, like, somebody to witness your life. You know? Somebody to stand there and just be with you and see What is happening So there's that angle. I guess it's just it's a strip. Be strange to me because I'm even I'm I'm looking at this girl and I'm like, bitch, I'm okay. Listen. For some somehow, which I don't really even understand fully, somehow Tomorrow, this is the weird because I don't know if we have stuff in common. You know what I mean? I don't know if we have things in common necessarily. Right? I mean, we she we both like to dance, but she actually still goes out and she actually iOS still young and like, whatever and dances. But in in the real sense, you know, but we like, we talked all day. I mean, but we have different cultures and we have different know, we don't know about each other yet, so we're still learning a bunch of shit. But it's like, yeah. Like, what you know and and again, maybe we're and and jumping the shark, but I'm even thinking just even on a meta level, like, like, do you I don't because to me, I don't even to me on one hand, I feel like you can genuinely and I think this is true. I mean, this is arranged marriage. I think you could literally just pick a human being and say fuck it. I'm in there. And we're gonna figure it the fuck out. So know what I mean? And so on one hand, I don't know if there is such a thing as, like, of course, there is such a thing as compatibility and you know, desire and you know, there's there's a lot of stuff, but at the same time, of course, people don't wanna try. But as to me, the other part, the other real and the real part of the coin is, like, it's 2 people wanna Try If 2 people are trying, then to me then there's nothing and that's the key, of course. Like, both people have to try and both people have to feel like they wanna try. But if they're trying, like, that. Like, you could literally be 2 fucking random individuals on the planet and they can fuck probably make it work to whatever extent. I don't I don't know. I guess I mean, maybe maybe I'm because obviously, I mean, there's big things. Maybe it's like this lifestyle. I don't know. I I feel, you know, because I you know, you can be more clean or less clean or I guess there can be different compatibilities with different I don't know. And maybe and by the way by the way, I think and I think you know what? This is a you know what? You know what? You know what? And you know what this is. I think this is like a bullshit question. Be honest, I think it's a bullshit question. I don't think it's a real question. Okay. I think it's a bullshit question, and I'll tell you why. I'll tell you why because the level of nuance in this fucking answer or the whatever it is, it's like, yeah. Well, if you I how I I would answer myself because I think it's I feel like it's a little bit of a time wasting question, I don't know. How I I would answer myself is like Yes. There is such thing as like, theoretically, yes. On one hand, anybody can make anything work, but of course, with all these marriages and different things, you don't know their level of happiness. You don't what's going on. Now if you're talking about your life and your relationships and what you want out of everything, I think all that is up to you. In any given moment. And I think that in general, with this with regards to this specific girl, you enjoy the moments that you've spent with her thus far and you enjoy in on a continuing basis, you enjoy and you in your about the future moments you could spend together and to go ahead and worry about this potential future thing where you're sitting across the dinner table and wondering maybe maybe you want maybe you like, you won't know what to say to her all across the dinner table. That's fucking mental masturbation. And you need to relax and just go back to your life and do the thing that you're you're trying to do right now. Where you're enjoying yourself and you're doing your coding and you're doing all this stuff. Go back to coding. Relax, and do understand and deal with life on life terms. You don't have to plan everything out. You don't have to understand this future state. You don't have to understand in in in 1 month, in 5 months, what the fuck is gonna look like in the relation look like. Who the fuck knows what it's gonna look like? It could it could be completely different. You could change in in this amount of time. She could change in this amount of time. You might not like her after next month. Why are we even thinking about things on that level? And is it it it it doesn't even matter on that level because every individual is completely fucking different. So, you know, while while there might be a girl out there that's into specifically fashion, and specifically coding and all all the specific things. That, you know, You know, she the you know, there's other things that that might, you know, and then then it's just everything in everything can and can't work. Literally across the board. Sometimes, like, Everything in common, and it's too much in common. You're fucking doing it. Then there's other things where it's like opposites. And, you know, and then there's other things where it's like the values are aligned. And there's other things where, like, the fucking values are missing. Not necessarily the values are misaligned, but, like, even the things that they care about in this are are missile It's like but anything can probably work or not work, and it just depends on the temperament of the people that are involved. So it's a mental mass majority question. I think I had fun answering it myself. Yeah, I think it I think it's a time wasting question. Now that I'm looking at it, because yeah, because I think I I wanted to get out of doing the coding work that I was doing. So anyway, cheers.",

And maybe this is me taking up the shortcuts, but I literally was able to make, like, a finished complex like Telegram app, which multiple like, callbacks, right, with multiple things like multiple things. K. It's able to do that. You know? I've done it already. Or let's say I've I've yeah, I mean, I've done it. I I have done it. And somehow, dude, somehow, I you know, again, maybe this is the thing with the with the things the way that we're going to do it. I can't It's not getting it again. It's not getting it again. And I tell you, it is the most frustrating thing in the world fucking this thing's not pushing through. I mean, it's like am I you know, it's like losing your fucking mind. With this shit. It is not Working. It's like It's not working. I don't know what to say. It's just not working. And this is the point where you probably have to, like, have to shut it down you have to be quiet. And actually sit there and actually learn how to do the thing. You know? And that's what we're gonna have to do because but it's, yeah, it's fucking annoying because it's just this one little project, and I and it's something I just wanted to get done. I just wanted to get it done, and I wanna learn the other things. Right? But it's like, And I don't even I question the the value add of this thing because I don't know if the other guys are gonna be using and they would use it if it was quickly done and it was ready, But if it's not ready, I'm probably not gonna use it. You understand? It's like it's like this weird zone where it's like, yeah. If I got it done and it was ready, then they would probably use it. But if it's, like, gonna take a long time, it could be underwhelming. And it's like I might as well just give it up you know, But then again, every time know, I'm reminded and then could do it again. Anyway, I have to go to sleep now. I I or I have to, like, I have to go back and I don't know, at least an app for, like, 4 hours or something. I have to do a couple of things before I nap. I didn't sleep tonight. I tried. I didn't take any amphetamines or anything. They took any drugs and took any caffeine and just tried to power through and get this thing done. But I was not able to get it done. I mean, I made some progress, but I we just stalled out. And it just didn't go through. And I was surprised. I was I was so surprised. Because I got one piece. I got the piece, and it's like Okay. All we need to do is just add in all the other pieces, and it just wasn't It's just not working. It's just deleting every time I try to add something. It deletes everything that I just did. You know? And it just over and over. And it's so frustrating. But I have to I have to keep going. Yeah. I wasn't able to text all those people that I was gonna text. I don't know. Yeah. I just, you know, I feel yeah, I feel I'm disappointed. In myself. I feel like I promised, yeah, I mean, I thought I was gonna get a lot done, and, I wasn't able to get a lot Done. And I feel like I don't wanna yeah. I mean, I just it's like, you know, man, if I can't fucking put all this shit together, know, in, you know, really a couple months, Like, truly, I can't with this girl. You know what I mean? And it's and I and, of course, you can But it's not point. The point is if I can't, like, wrangle my life together And have some increased level of like, just not even comfortable Like, spending all that time communicating and doing everything. I I don't I I know it's more healthy, and we should, like but I just don't even care I want to be better I want this situation to be better. Want everything to be better, and it's like if it's not just fuck it all. Right. I just, like, who like, just let her go find it. The better guy. That is in a better place that's fucking has more money and that's attractive and has a big dick and lives in her country and Is is her a like, let her find that, and let me just I guess, suffer in purgatory. Man. It really just I'm in, Android guess, you know, obviously, I know I'm tired, and I'll sleep, and I'll wake up, and I'll feel probably fine, but it's bullshit. It's always fucking bullshit. It's bullshit to feel fine. I shouldn't feel fine. I should feel fucking light under my ass. Every fucking second. I should feel needles under my fucking fingernails. Should feel a spike in my eye. Should I see spider bite in my foot. Every fucking second that I've I'm not where I need to be and Anthropic extent to which I have comfort as the extent to which I stay the same. Man, that's bullshit. And I do not like myself and I do not like where we are. And, I know it's 180 from we talked about before, but I don't feel good, and I don't like it. And I'm gonna go home now.",

					"text": " Claude, tell you, I For the life of me, I don't I I I don't understand. For the life of me. I swear I get so close in these projects I swear, Claude. And maybe this is me taking up the shortcuts, but I literally was able to make, like, a finished complex like Telegram app, which multiple like, callbacks, right, with multiple things like multiple things. K. It's able to do that. You know? I've done it already. Or let's say I've I've yeah, I mean, I've done it. I I have done it. And somehow, dude, somehow, I you know, again, maybe this is the thing with the with the things the way that we're going to do it. I can't It's not getting it again. It's not getting it again. And I tell you, it is the most frustrating thing in the world fucking this thing's not pushing through. I mean, it's like am I you know, it's like losing your fucking mind. With this shit. It is not Working. It's like It's not working. I don't know what to say. It's just not working. And this is the point where you probably have to, like, have to shut it down you have to be quiet. And actually sit there and actually learn how to do the thing. You know? And that's what we're gonna have to do because but it's, yeah, it's fucking annoying because it's just this one little project, and I and it's something I just wanted to get done. I just wanted to get it done, and I wanna learn the other things. Right? But it's like, And I don't even I question the the value add of this thing because I don't know if the other guys are gonna be using and they would use it if it was quickly done and it was ready, But if it's not ready, I'm probably not gonna use it. You understand? It's like it's like this weird zone where it's like, yeah. If I got it done and it was ready, then they would probably use it. But if it's, like, gonna take a long time, it could be underwhelming. And it's like I might as well just give it up you know, But then again, every time know, I'm reminded and then could do it again. Anyway, I have to go to sleep now. I I or I have to, like, I have to go back and I don't know, at least an app for, like, 4 hours or something. I have to do a couple of things before I nap. I didn't sleep tonight. I tried. I didn't take any amphetamines or anything. They took any drugs and took any caffeine and just tried to power through and get this thing done. But I was not able to get it done. I mean, I made some progress, but I we just stalled out. And it just didn't go through. And I was surprised. I was I was so surprised. Because I got one piece. I got the piece, and it's like Okay. All we need to do is just add in all the other pieces, and it just wasn't It's just not working. It's just deleting every time I try to add something. It deletes everything that I just did. You know? And it just over and over. And it's so frustrating. But I have to I have to keep going. Yeah. I wasn't able to text all those people that I was gonna text. I don't know. Yeah. I just, you know, I feel yeah, I feel I'm disappointed. In myself. I feel like I promised, yeah, I mean, I thought I was gonna get a lot done, and, I wasn't able to get a lot Done. And I feel like I don't wanna yeah. I mean, I just it's like, you know, man, if I can't fucking put all this shit together, know, in, you know, really a couple months, Like, truly, I can't with this girl. You know what I mean?

			"text": "Wow, who talked for a while and I didn\u2019t go through so I\u2019m gonna try to make this one a little bit quicker well fuck damn I just talked for a long time. Anyway we try to make this phone quicker so anyway long story short talk with the girl yesterday, it was kind of fun back-and-forth. It was actually more fun than I expected And it\u2019s way more because of me than it is because of her, but she gives me opportunities to perform and have fun and in you know the extent which I take them as the extent to which I have a better time I just wish that she would participate more in those moments you know I just that\u2019s that\u2019s my only thing if you would participate more than those opportunities in those moments then we\u2019d like we\u2019d be you know it would be really cool cause like last night she told me like hey why don\u2019t you know it was like the code wasn\u2019t working She said like maybe it\u2019s a good time to send a pic. Send a spicy pic out of the blue and I was like OK you know my first thought is like I don\u2019t know. OK I mean I don\u2019t know if I had a thought for sake, but I was like OK that\u2019s sexy. It\u2019s kinda hot. I mean I\u2019ve never done that before really I think I\u2019ve sent a picture once to my ex maybe once or twice for fun but nothing like no definitely never like a girl when I\u2019m kind of random random but definitely not Instagram because we\u2019re still communicating mainly on Instagram that\u2019s wild. You could just fucking share that shitcause most of the stuff I sent you know I\u2019m I have enough for me when I talk about you, bro have some balls send it fucking flat. You know what I mean when I say send a flat. Send it to the chat let him save it have some balls have some dignity but at the same time obviously it\u2019s like you know the leaks and everything these days I mean, you know it\u2019s gonna get leaked someday but that\u2019s fine. Yeah I don\u2019t know yet. It\u2019s the reciprocal cause she asked me to send it and I was like OK I\u2019ll start playing around, but you know part of the game is like kind of trying to see if the other person is willing to you know participate should want to send something to get me started like a little you know half titty or something you know whatever but she said she basically said no you know You know I can\u2019t has excuses of reasons at least you didn\u2019t say politics this time you know she just had other reasons and what I have sent her my dick 100 I would\u2019ve 100% done it but here it\u2019s just like it\u2019s the gap in between like somebody\u2019s sitting in on a couch somewhere like just getting naked photos. It\u2019s like that\u2019s wild man or videos. It\u2019s like it\u2019s crazy. You know what I mean that\u2019s crazy behavior And I would love to just do that for her but I guess there\u2019s just I don\u2019t believe also there\u2019s like I mean I think I think I think I have trauma, but it\u2019s like I have just I feel like I\u2019ve seen girls play with guys and get stuff out of them and then use that stuff and laugh at those guys you know and I just I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a real memory or if it\u2019s a real you know but it\u2019s just like I\u2019m wary of it. I don\u2019t usually wanna send naked photos or anything like that so I\u2019m like wary of it but you know if the other person sending something then you at least know like they\u2019re in it with you if you\u2019re not just you know what I mean if it\u2019s just one-sided then it\u2019s like this is shady. You know what I mean obviously it was one side is like no what are you trying to do here? Remember, there was a time I remember I was like 2423 or 22 23. I was so close to sending literally a random person a picture of my dick. It was probably a girl from like Bumble or Tinder but I remember at the last minute I remember thinking like this could just be one of my friends playing a prank on me. This could be anything this could be anything And I don\u2019t know what this person looks like and then I started pushing back on them like well can you just send me a selfie or anything and then of course they said no and so I was like well obviously I\u2019m not gonna send anything so I but I was so close and I didn\u2019t before I even checked on if the person was even fucking real, so you know immediately if I see anything now I\u2019m like well you know I might obviously I know she\u2019s real but like my first thought is like you know we go through. We have to go see and see if it\u2019s reciprocal. I\u2019m willing but like to see if it\u2019s reciprocal and it wasn\u2019t so since it wasn\u2019t reciprocal, I decided to just go a different route and kind of play around. It\u2019s like teasing a little bit like I would do something Again. This is like explicit thoughts per se. It\u2019s more just vibes cause I\u2019m not having like words in my head it\u2019s just like this is what I\u2019m feeling and/doing and so I ended up instead of so I ended up just going the route cause it\u2019s like yeah I\u2019m just I\u2019m responding. I\u2019m just in the moment and I\u2019m like OK. Well it\u2019s OK. She willing to participate no she\u2019s not OK. Well she\u2019s not willing to participate. I\u2019m not gonna send her dick or video of my dick so like what\u2019s the middle ground? What\u2019s the other part so I can teaser around but she still kind of pushing for something so I\u2019m like I mean I literally can\u2019t send her my dick. It\u2019s just not possible and I say not possible in a probably I wanna say boundaries way, but like it\u2019s kind of a boundary like yeah I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not sending you shit without something. You know I\u2019m leaving here with something. If you know the Denzel Washington me I\u2019m leaving it with something so so I ended up going a different route I sent you some voice messages. Kind of you know telling her like hey I wanna play this game like what I would do if you were here and I just went along to just you know the one thing I anyway allegedly she liked it a lot you know and then I proceeded to you know this is again. This is like something I used to do all the time but with TikTok, I remember the joy I had with you know I\u2019m just setting up my camera in my room and just you know, dancing and being foolish and seeing all the reactions and it was always and then even doing the same thing in Vegas, you know dancing seen the reactions going on public and it was always just it was always joy seeing the reactions and seeing people you know some people are having fun at your expense, but that\u2019s kind of rare. Most people are just enjoying the fact that somebody else is just wild and they can\u2019t but they can see you while and then maybe maybe you give them the opportunity to participate as well and then they can. it\u2019s like giving them permission so man I love that but I don\u2019t do it that much these days more I mean social media I feel like I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ll do it again cause I did like it, but I think I think this is like the first step to be honest this type of thing with this girl it\u2019s like the first step to cause I think I mean in honestly cause so what I did basically from there, I made a couple videos for her just like half stripping like not really some music and it\u2019s kind of funny and then you know I made another video which like I was shirtless and pants, but you couldn\u2019t see my underwear, but I was covering it up with the guitar and then playing bad music you know and so it\u2019s like stupid and it\u2019s in my opinion. It\u2019s bad content. OK it\u2019s bad content, but she allegedly you know she expressed a lot of messages like that. She really liked it right I can only tell what she said. I don\u2019t know her actual thing, but it seemed genuine. It is an interesting idea that in general, I question the genuine nature of any of the stuff she says, and it\u2019s not necessarily because of her it\u2019s like one level because of her but the other level looks like I guess it\u2019s similar to whenever you know she likes me and she\u2019s kissing me and she\u2019s like with me, even though you know, my facial hair is wild and like I\u2019m not dressing you know I\u2019m dressing wild and I remember my friend dude with my friend the other day he\u2019s like yo he looked at me. He was like dude like you know he\u2019s texting these girls and I\u2019m like yeah I\u2019m done. I\u2019m not I\u2019m not texting girls anymore in Thailand at all. I\u2019m done and he\u2019s like yeah man but you could like all you gotta do I saw you know I saw black guy with a girl yesterday and he looked good but he was just nice like he was dressed up. You know if you just cut your beard and you dress nice and then then you can you know then you can have any anything and I was saying I don\u2019t want it. I truly don\u2019t want it I don\u2019t want it straight up especially in Thailand maybe in an east Europe I can I could clean up just you know but it\u2019s like here now 0% and I don\u2019t even want. I want these girls. I don\u2019t wanna try. I don\u2019t want any of the culture the whole thing of like the prude culture the level of it\u2019s not performed. I have to become somebody else. I have to do something else you have to like fundamentally I have to stop a girl in the street and just I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m truly not interested at this point and it\u2019s probably slightly honest could be racist, but it\u2019s like I see these cute Thai girls and I\u2019m just off. I\u2019m completely off not even even if they smiled at me. I just it\u2019s off cause I\u2019m not gonna go and fucking sit with this girl and talk and not talk. You know what I mean and not touch or not. Tell you know what I mean like do all this stuff is completely different culture completely different vibes and I\u2019m done with it OK and I\u2019m done for all the other reasons I\u2019ve talked about but anyway, but it was interesting. He said that so it\u2019s like somebody that somebody that likes you in spite of you know you not doing all the conventional things to be attractive, it\u2019s like that\u2019s a little bit. You know you\u2019re like something wrong here what\u2019s going on? Am I on camera and so and then it\u2019s the same thing here it\u2019s like if somebody is liking you the videos and they\u2019re bad you\u2019re like OK well what\u2019s going on here like you know what I mean like was there a joke like just double checking everything OK cause obviously yeah it\u2019s not good. What\u2019s interesting that\u2019s another question the authenticity oh yeah you question the authenticity on the positive stuff and not on the negative stuff but I mean that\u2019s cause I mean people are positive. No one\u2019s negative for ulterior motives. I mean that\u2019s not true but like genuine genuinely people are gonna be hassles and then they might be nice but like anyway I don\u2019t know that\u2019s just too much of a generalization anyway so I sent that stuff and she enjoyed it allegedly so anyway I just wanted to say about that that was interesting thing yesterday I feel like I had some more stuff but I forgot it cause it\u2019s like my third time recording it because the first two times the audio didn\u2019t get captured anyway the next thing the last thing that I wanted to go over and one of the more interesting things is for the app. OK because I\u2019m I\u2019m trying to clue on what I\u2019m doing here and one of the things I\u2019m doing here is kind of this like this level of brain dumping or like you know and it brain dumping and then but I\u2019m, but I\u2019m getting something out of it like you know so I guess I need a few. I\u2019m asking for a few things explicitly here number one number one. I think I don\u2019t know what your prompt is. I would say the only thing I would change in the prompts or whatever you\u2019re doing. Is that the way like for I probably modify the prompts to be more conversational you know because at the very end of the you know all your post you had like three things like three kind of directions that we can go in and I think even the app I would like that and they would appear as like almost like in-line buttons, but in the actual, the actual person wouldn\u2019t say anything you know the actual, you know, AI wouldn\u2019t tell those things it would just it would ask one point of question or would make a statement and I wanted to you know I would want to go back and I would want to actually be human in in a way and in and that entails like sometimes you\u2019re gonna make a statement and that\u2019s you know what I mean it\u2019s not gonna somebody could respond to the statement but it\u2019s a statement and then other times you\u2019re looking to get more out of the person you know, but I guess is a therapist as well. They usually end with questions pull more things out of the person and make them more comfortable so I guess it\u2019s 50-50 but yeah I guess probably traditional therapy is way more like way more like that anyway so I guess the question is a few questions. Number one is some general question about prompting there\u2019s a question about the actual name of the app. I was thinking like vocal dump or it is kind of an ugly name vocal dump brain dump.io but brain dump sounds more like a brainstorming app than it is like a you know if you say brain, I\u2019m not thinking like I\u2019m you know, but I don\u2019t want you know that just a bunch of traditional names. Call anything with calm no, we\u2019re not doing anything with calm original idea which is kind of protocol one, but it\u2019s nebulous. You don\u2019t necessarily know what protocol one is just from the name or protocol emergency protocol in emergency. You can\u2019t get that on any App Store. Could you get the name and probably you know put it you know you can put in the domain but even that it\u2019s like emergency protocol. It sounds way more like a set of SOP\u2018s for emergency protocols or something or it\u2019s like it is an emergency protocol, but it\u2019s not I don\u2019t immediately think of anyway I don\u2019t necessarily want us to be an app that people only go to for emergencies. It\u2019s like no you go to this when you need to just offload a bunch of shit and I might be even offload.io. You know unpack.io you know offload is kinda nice but yeah that\u2019s the idea. Like just get in there dump you know and you can and then but it\u2019s like it\u2019s understanding the patters understanding the day I think that\u2019s one level is kind of understanding where you\u2019re at for the day, kind of coming up with a plan for the rest of the day or the next day or the week and then you know whenever you\u2019re talking to it you know you can kind of track your progress against you know what the AI knows you know so they I know you\u2019re working on the stuff it it asks about it what would be cool as if there was some UI to kind of go along with that but what I think is you know and I do like you know before we talked about checking in you know daily check-in I like that current streak I kinda like it yeah current streak actually I mean everything we had was pretty good but definitely needs to be vocal based no writing at all maybe you can. You can write you know need people should have the ability cause sometimes I can\u2019t talk right honestly what we had before even that you are that we had the main view on the dashboard kinda nice but we do need some like I saw I\u2019ve seen a couple interfaces where I don\u2019t think we have to innovate as far as the UI go so we can keep it. It\u2019s kind of done. We can keep it simple and keep the chat bubbles kind of going back-and-forth with the emotions like but I think on the right side of the screen I want well I mean we have a lot of freedom here right now, but I have a dashboard set up and I like the dashboard set up so maybe on the left on the left side we have you know kind of more you know chat histories we have central dashboard chat his history settings. I don\u2019t know what else let me look at with the possible I\u2019m looking at yeah I mean I\u2019m looking at shit. I don\u2019t have the thing open open. Yeah I\u2019m looking at it so it\u2019s like yeah of course we have something like you know the divider line than the word that\u2019s like either chat histories we have activity or something like that and it\u2019s just like a list of you know the chats. I guess maybe it starts to you know a list of chats. I\u2019m thinking like above of course you probably have a main dashboard but on the main dashboard, you know I guess you could have patterns maybe identify patterns or like I don\u2019t know what you know if we have a but maybe we don\u2019t yeah I mean if we have a tube I don\u2019t want it again. I don\u2019t want to like you I exist for a reason and things of existed for a reason we don\u2019t have to break the fucking idea of what exist but yeah within that side bar the first side bar what are we throwing in there? What\u2019s the name of the app or what some more ideas I think maybe I came up with some nice ones but if you have some additional ones empathy dump dump dump is a tough one dump is not good. Dump is tough. You know dump is not a good word. You don\u2019t want the word dump in your. It\u2019s not a good word is there anything else maybe resources section on the side there so maybe like resources maybe chat history/activity and at the very top we have like the dashboard and the dashboard as you know you know I don\u2019t know it\u2019s specific to the user so basically use a profile where they can kind of top level C stuff we have we had some mock up but yeah because I use Gemini the other day and I just use the talking. They are like a choking benefit interface and it was just similar to any other chat but where you\u2019re talking and then it\u2019s responding kind of in that central window and I\u2019m like well honestly that works like why why fuck with that why go to go to zero I guess there is one thing if you don\u2019t have anything to look at on the screen like if it\u2019s just a dot that\u2019s processing or talking then you\u2019re more in the mode of speaking I guess right you\u2019re more in the motive just talking to the thing because it\u2019s you know you have nothing to look at and you\u2019re not reading so I guess that\u2019s a plus I guess so I guess compare and contrast that\u2019ll be the last thing as a compared contrast like you know what would be the reason why somebody would go with kind of that traditional chat bubble back-and-forth where you can see what they say you\u2019re saying and they\u2019re saying versus that other one where it\u2019s just a dot in the center of the screen and you know cause my feeling is obviously if you do have a more traditional kind of chapel set up like theoretically you can you could add things like the buttons, but but then that takes away from yeah Eileen lean towards the other one towards just like a bubble or some situation like that where it\u2019s just you\u2019re able to push, but then you know I like the idea as well, but you know that transcript when you can like read, I guess you can still get a transcript later right you can still get a transcript later, but even in the car, I found myself in the conversation sometimes even my behavior I found myself scrolling up to read some of the stuff we talked about before and to see like what I said and what it said and I was reflecting on what the AI said so I think and I think because of my my usage I would leave it as like chat bubbles, you know and that back-and-forth because because of that because sometimes that insight is power so powerful that it\u2019s like yeah I need I need it I want it yeah and I guess you know one of the things that I wanted to balance is you know that the conversation back-and-forth cause this is gonna be the thing with the prompting I mean this the main thing here is gonna be the prompting it\u2019s gonna be the most important thing it\u2019s like figuring out how to you know number one we have to start the conversation and we gotta start pre-naturally, probably from from the outside we wanna start something and we wanna get the user to you know to in the divulge to talk to talk right and then from there we probably need more information but at some point we wanna start giving some insight so we may be able to do that immediately oh that sounds like this type of pattern but let me let me hear more about what\u2019s going on like, have you had another situation in life like this you know is there something else going on you know or even hey you know it sounds like you know you know it sounds like this but at the same time it seems like you\u2019re hiding something or you may not be giving me the full story but you know it\u2019s like it\u2019s like challenging and it\u2019s like it\u2019s really man. We\u2019re really looking for human like behavior here. It\u2019s like you can see you can see it\u2019s like you kind of you\u2019re flexible to go anyway depending on the user and what they\u2019re saying, whether you get more information or whether you kind move to a place where we\u2019re going into like not necessarily solution but like a pattern, you know where you\u2019re going to some sort of understanding phase where you\u2019re like trying to like presenting what you think and then getting the users feedback on what you think they\u2019re going through and how you how your kind of defining what you\u2019ve heard so far and seeing if the user kind of agrees with that offer, I mean for me that was the point where I was like holy shit this thing really understands me and that could be really powerful moment and I don\u2019t necessarily want that part broken up a ton with you know clarifying questions or like verification questions but there is a value to it so it\u2019s a balance and then ultimately of course we need to lead the conversation to an end probably within 30 minutes to an hour right you know it has to it\u2019s kind of close out with some action items with some lessons with some patterns with some things to go forward for the week you know it it has to wrap up consistently, you know and one of the things you know in general is that you know sometimes people don\u2019t have the full-time you know some people that sometimes you just hop in and you know you just you want to look kind of brain down something and then that\u2019s it and maybe maybe that\u2019s a button you know what I mean it\u2019s like it\u2019s like a dump. Maybe it\u2019s like a butt. It\u2019s a you know it\u2019s a button or it\u2019s a setting or a thing that you could just press and say like hey I\u2019m just like recording this dump and I want just you know and I want a response. I do wanna response but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m not gonna go back-and-forth a bunch you know, but I don\u2019t know what that means. I don\u2019t know what that looks like exactly but just something where it\u2019s like cause often I just hop in and I\u2019m like I\u2019m only planning on recording really one dump and seeing what the response are is and then seeing kind of the results in the video of my patterns and just seeing the update and then you know, I\u2019m only planning on really sending one maybe two things and then maybe later on the evening I wanna go back-and-forth on a specific topic but like sometimes I just wanna dump and then for that that should be a thing because at the same time you know it doesn\u2019t you know if the AI is asking like well tell me a little bit more about that you know it\u2019s like that doesn\u2019t that\u2019s not relevant you just I just wanna see the patterns. I just wanna see the thing so I can just immediately maybe I am having a situation in the moment and I need to see the breakdown. It\u2019s like then we need to do you know what I mean you know and I need to see the breakdown immediately because I have a situation right there and I need to see OK I\u2019m having situation right now. What patterns you know I think I know what patterns it is you know what to do but I just want another opinion, but we just need that. We just need that you know what I mean and maybe that is like the emergency kind of emergency protocol but it\u2019s not really that it\u2019s something else kinda like a dump mode or just you know like one response or one shot I don\u2019t know what you wanna call one shot motor you know and that\u2019s kind of a different thing than like a whole daily reflection or a daily log or something like that like a back-and-forth like there\u2019s probably a couple different modes. It\u2019s probably really more. It\u2019s probably you know but it\u2019s like at least two modes one is like hey this kinda like a dump one shot and then you know that\u2019s where we\u2019re just like boom quick you know dump one shot seeing what\u2019s going on and moving and then there\u2019s one more it\u2019s like we\u2019re really gonna be working through something we\u2019re gonna get an idea and and then we\u2019re gonna talk about stuff and that\u2019s a different thing",

					"text": "Wow, who talked for a while and I didn\u2019t go through so I\u2019m gonna try to make this one a little bit quicker well fuck damn I just talked for a long time. Anyway we try to make this phone quicker so anyway long story short talk with the girl yesterday, it was kind of fun back-and-forth. It was actually more fun than I expected And it\u2019s way more because of me than it is because of her, but she gives me opportunities to perform and have fun and in you know the extent which I take them as the extent to which I have a better time I just wish that she would participate more in those moments you know I just that\u2019s that\u2019s my only thing if you would participate more than those opportunities in those moments then we\u2019d like we\u2019d be you know it would be really cool cause like last night she told me like hey why don\u2019t you know it was like the code wasn\u2019t working She said like maybe it\u2019s a good time to send a pic. Send a spicy pic out of the blue and I was like OK you know my first thought is like I don\u2019t know. OK I mean I don\u2019t know if I had a thought for sake, but I was like OK that\u2019s sexy. It\u2019s kinda hot. I mean I\u2019ve never done that before really I think I\u2019ve sent a picture once to my ex maybe once or twice for fun but nothing like no definitely never like a girl when I\u2019m kind of random random but definitely not Instagram because we\u2019re still communicating mainly on Instagram that\u2019s wild. You could just fucking share that shitcause most of the stuff I sent you know I\u2019m I have enough for me when I talk about you, bro have some balls send it fucking flat. You know what I mean when I say send a flat. Send it to the chat let him save it have some balls have some dignity but at the same time obviously it\u2019s like you know the leaks and everything these days I mean, you know it\u2019s gonna get leaked someday but that\u2019s fine. Yeah I don\u2019t know yet. It\u2019s the reciprocal cause she asked me to send it and I was like OK I\u2019ll start playing around, but you know part of the game is like kind of trying to see if the other person is willing to you know participate should want to send something to get me started like a little you know half titty or something you know whatever but she said she basically said no you know You know I can\u2019t has excuses of reasons at least you didn\u2019t say politics this time you know she just had other reasons and what I have sent her my dick 100 I would\u2019ve 100% done it but here it\u2019s just like it\u2019s the gap in between like somebody\u2019s sitting in on a couch somewhere like just getting naked photos. It\u2019s like that\u2019s wild man or videos. It\u2019s like it\u2019s crazy. You know what I mean that\u2019s crazy behavior And I would love to just do that for her but I guess there\u2019s just I don\u2019t believe also there\u2019s like I mean I think I think I think I have trauma, but it\u2019s like I have just I feel like I\u2019ve seen girls play with guys and get stuff out of them and then use that stuff and laugh at those guys you know and I just I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a real memory or if it\u2019s a real you know but it\u2019s just like I\u2019m wary of it. I don\u2019t usually wanna send naked photos or anything like that so I\u2019m like wary of it but you know if the other person sending something then you at least know like they\u2019re in it with you if you\u2019re not just you know what I mean if it\u2019s just one-sided then it\u2019s like this is shady. You know what I mean obviously it was one side is like no what are you trying to do here? Remember, there was a time I remember I was like 2423 or 22 23. I was so close to sending literally a random person a picture of my dick. It was probably a girl from like Bumble or Tinder but I remember at the last minute I remember thinking like this could just be one of my friends playing a prank on me. This could be anything this could be anything And I don\u2019t know what this person looks like and then I started pushing back on them like well can you just send me a selfie or anything and then of course they said no and so I was like well obviously I\u2019m not gonna send anything so I but I was so close and I didn\u2019t before I even checked on if the person was even fucking real, so you know immediately if I see anything now I\u2019m like well you know I might obviously I know she\u2019s real but like my first thought is like you know we go through. We have to go see and see if it\u2019s reciprocal. I\u2019m willing but like to see if it\u2019s reciprocal and it wasn\u2019t so since it wasn\u2019t reciprocal, I decided to just go a different route and kind of play around. It\u2019s like teasing a little bit like I would do something Again. This is like explicit thoughts per se. It\u2019s more just vibes cause I\u2019m not having like words in my head it\u2019s just like this is what I\u2019m feeling and/doing and so I ended up instead of so I ended up just going the route cause it\u2019s like yeah I\u2019m just I\u2019m responding. I\u2019m just in the moment and I\u2019m like OK. Well it\u2019s OK. She willing to participate no she\u2019s not OK. Well she\u2019s not willing to participate. I\u2019m not gonna send her dick or video of my dick so like what\u2019s the middle ground? What\u2019s the other part so I can teaser around but she still kind of pushing for something so I\u2019m like I mean I literally can\u2019t send her my dick. It\u2019s just not possible and I say not possible in a probably I wanna say boundaries way, but like it\u2019s kind of a boundary like yeah I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not sending you shit without something. You know I\u2019m leaving here with something. If you know the Denzel Washington me I\u2019m leaving it with something so so I ended up going a different route I sent you some voice messages. Kind of you know telling her like hey I wanna play this game like what I would do if you were here and I just went along to just you know the one thing I anyway allegedly she liked it a lot you know and then I proceeded to you know this is again. This is like something I used to do all the time but with TikTok, I remember the joy I had with you know I\u2019m just setting up my camera in my room and just you know, dancing and being foolish and seeing all the reactions and it was always and then even doing the same thing in Vegas, you know dancing seen the reactions going on public and it was always just it was always joy seeing the reactions and seeing people you know some people are having fun at your expense, but that\u2019s kind of rare. Most people are just enjoying the fact that somebody else is just wild and they can\u2019t but they can see you while and then maybe maybe you give them the opportunity to participate as well and then they can. it\u2019s like giving them permission so man I love that but I don\u2019t do it that much these days more I mean social media I feel like I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ll do it again cause I did like it, but I think I think this is like the first step to be honest this type of thing with this girl it\u2019s like the first step to cause I think I mean in honestly cause so what I did basically from there, I made a couple videos for her just like half stripping like not really some music and it\u2019s kind of funny and then you know I made another video which like I was shirtless and pants, but you couldn\u2019t see my underwear, but I was covering it up with the guitar and then playing bad music you know and so it\u2019s like stupid and it\u2019s in my opinion. It\u2019s bad content. OK it\u2019s bad content, but she allegedly you know she expressed a lot of messages like that. She really liked it right I can only tell what she said. I don\u2019t know her actual thing, but it seemed genuine. It is an interesting idea that in general, I question the genuine nature of any of the stuff she says, and it\u2019s not necessarily because of her it\u2019s like one level because of her but the other level looks like I guess it\u2019s similar to whenever you know she likes me and she\u2019s kissing me and she\u2019s like with me, even though you know, my facial hair is wild and like I\u2019m not dressing you know I\u2019m dressing wild and I remember my friend dude with my friend the other day he\u2019s like yo he looked at me. He was like dude like you know he\u2019s texting these girls and I\u2019m like yeah I\u2019m done. I\u2019m not I\u2019m not texting girls anymore in Thailand at all. I\u2019m done and he\u2019s like yeah man but you could like all you gotta do I saw you know I saw black guy with a girl yesterday and he looked good but he was just nice like he was dressed up. You know if you just cut your beard and you dress nice and then then you can you know then you can have any anything and I was saying I don\u2019t want it. I truly don\u2019t want it I don\u2019t want it straight up especially in Thailand maybe in an east Europe I can I could clean up just you know but it\u2019s like here now 0% and I don\u2019t even want. I want these girls. I don\u2019t wanna try. I don\u2019t want any of the culture the whole thing of like the prude culture the level of it\u2019s not performed. I have to become somebody else. I have to do something else you have to like fundamentally I have to stop a girl in the street and just I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m truly not interested at this point and it\u2019s probably slightly honest could be racist, but it\u2019s like I see these cute Thai girls and I\u2019m just off. I\u2019m completely off not even even if they smiled at me. I just it\u2019s off cause I\u2019m not gonna go and fucking sit with this girl and talk and not talk. You know what I mean and not touch or not. Tell you know what I mean like do all this stuff is completely different culture completely different vibes and I\u2019m done with it OK and I\u2019m done for all the other reasons I\u2019ve talked about but anyway, but it was interesting. He said that so it\u2019s like somebody that somebody that likes you in spite of you know you not doing all the conventional things to be attractive, it\u2019s like that\u2019s a little bit. You know you\u2019re like something wrong here what\u2019s going on? Am I on camera and so and then it\u2019s the same thing here it\u2019s like if somebody is liking you the videos and they\u2019re bad you\u2019re like OK well what\u2019s going on here like you know what I mean like was there a joke like just double checking everything OK cause obviously yeah it\u2019s not good. What\u2019s interesting that\u2019s another question the authenticity oh yeah you question the authenticity on the positive stuff and not on the negative stuff but I mean that\u2019s cause I mean people are positive. No one\u2019s negative for ulterior motives. I mean that\u2019s not true but like genuine genuinely people are gonna be hassles and then they might be nice but like anyway I don\u2019t know that\u2019s just too much of a generalization anyway so I sent that stuff and she enjoyed it allegedly so anyway I just wanted to say about that that was interesting thing yesterday I feel like I had some more stuff but I forgot it cause it\u2019s like my third time recording it because the first two times the audio didn\u2019t get captured anyway the next thing the last thing that I wanted to go over and one of the more interesting things is for the app. OK because I\u2019m I\u2019m trying to clue on what I\u2019m doing here and one of the things I\u2019m doing here is kind of this like this level of brain dumping or like you know and it brain dumping and then but I\u2019m, but I\u2019m getting something out of it like you know so I guess I need a few. I\u2019m asking for a few things explicitly here number one number one. I think I don\u2019t know what your prompt is. I would say the only thing I would change in the prompts or whatever you\u2019re doing. Is that the way like for I probably modify the prompts to be more conversational you know because at the very end of the you know all your post you had like three things like three kind of directions that we can go in and I think even the app I would like that and they would appear as like almost like in-line buttons, but in the actual, the actual person wouldn\u2019t say anything you know the actual, you know, AI wouldn\u2019t tell those things it would just it would ask one point of question or would make a statement and I wanted to you know I would want to go back and I would want to actually be human in in a way and in and that entails like sometimes you\u2019re gonna make a statement and that\u2019s you know what I mean it\u2019s not gonna somebody could respond to the statement but it\u2019s a statement and then other times you\u2019re looking to get more out of the person you know, but I guess is a therapist as well. They usually end with questions pull more things out of the person and make them more comfortable so I guess it\u2019s 50-50 but yeah I guess probably traditional therapy is way more like way more like that anyway so I guess the question is a few questions. Number one is some general question about prompting there\u2019s a question about the actual name of the app. I was thinking like vocal dump or it is kind of an ugly name vocal dump brain dump.io but brain dump sounds more like a brainstorming app than it is like a you know if you say brain, I\u2019m not thinking like I\u2019m you know, but I don\u2019t want you know that just a bunch of traditional names. Call anything with calm no, we\u2019re not doing anything with calm original idea which is kind of protocol one, but it\u2019s nebulous. You don\u2019t necessarily know what protocol one is just from the name or protocol emergency protocol in emergency. You can\u2019t get that on any App Store. Could you get the name and probably you know put it you know you can put in the domain but even that it\u2019s like emergency protocol. It sounds way more like a set of SOP\u2018s for emergency protocols or something or it\u2019s like it is an emergency protocol, but it\u2019s not I don\u2019t immediately think of anyway I don\u2019t necessarily want us to be an app that people only go to for emergencies. It\u2019s like no you go to this when you need to just offload a bunch of shit and I might be even offload.io. You know unpack.io you know offload is kinda nice but yeah that\u2019s the idea. Like just get in there dump you know and you can and then but it\u2019s like it\u2019s understanding the patters understanding the day I think that\u2019s one level is kind of understanding where you\u2019re at for the day, kind of coming up with a plan for the rest of the day or the next day or the week and then you know whenever you\u2019re talking to it you know you can kind of track your progress against you know what the AI knows you know so they I know you\u2019re working on the stuff it it asks about it what would be cool as if there was some UI to kind of go along with that but what I think is you know and I do like you know before we talked about checking in you know daily check-in I like that current streak I kinda like it yeah current streak actually I mean everything we had was pretty good but definitely needs to be vocal based no writing at all maybe you can. You can write you know need people should have the ability cause sometimes I can\u2019t talk right honestly what we had before even that you are that we had the main view on the dashboard kinda nice but we do need some like I saw I\u2019ve seen a couple interfaces where I don\u2019t think we have to innovate as far as the UI go so we can keep it. It\u2019s kind of done. We can keep it simple and keep the chat bubbles kind of going back-and-forth with the emotions like but I think on the right side of the screen I want well I mean we have a lot of freedom here right now, but I have a dashboard set up and I like the dashboard set up so maybe on the left on the left side we have you know kind of more you know chat histories we have central dashboard chat his history settings. I don\u2019t know what else let me look at with the possible I\u2019m looking at yeah I mean I\u2019m looking at shit. I don\u2019t have the thing open open. Yeah I\u2019m looking at it so it\u2019s like yeah of course we have something like you know the divider line than the word that\u2019s like either chat histories we have activity or something like that and it\u2019s just like a list of you know the chats. I guess maybe it starts to you know a list of chats. I\u2019m thinking like above of course you probably have a main dashboard but on the main dashboard, you know I guess you could have patterns maybe identify patterns or like I don\u2019t know what you know if we have a but maybe we don\u2019t yeah I mean if we have a tube I don\u2019t want it again. I don\u2019t want to like you I exist for a reason and things of existed for a reason we don\u2019t have to break the fucking idea of what exist but yeah within that side bar the first side bar what are we throwing in there? What\u2019s the name of the app or what some more ideas I think maybe I came up with some nice ones but if you have some additional ones empathy dump dump dump is a tough one dump is not good. Dump is tough. You know dump is not a good word. You don\u2019t want the word dump in your. It\u2019s not a good word is there anything else maybe resources section on the side there so maybe like resources maybe chat history/activity and at the very top we have like the dashboard and the dashboard as you know you know I don\u2019t know it\u2019s specific to the user so basically use a profile where they can kind of top level C stuff we have we had some mock up but yeah because I use Gemini the other day and I just use the talking. They are like a choking benefit interface and it was just similar to any other chat but where you\u2019re talking and then it\u2019s responding kind of in that central window and I\u2019m like well honestly that works like why why fuck with that why go to go to zero I guess there is one thing if you don\u2019t have anything to look at on the screen like if it\u2019s just a dot that\u2019s processing or talking then you\u2019re more in the mode of speaking I guess right you\u2019re more in the motive just talking to the thing because it\u2019s you know you have nothing to look at and you\u2019re not reading so I guess that\u2019s a plus I guess so I guess compare and contrast that\u2019ll be the last thing as a compared contrast like you know what would be the reason why somebody would go with kind of that traditional chat bubble back-and-forth where you can see what they say you\u2019re saying and they\u2019re saying versus that other one where it\u2019s just a dot in the center of the screen and you know cause my feeling is obviously if you do have a more traditional kind of chapel set up like theoretically you can you could add things like the buttons, but but then that takes away from yeah Eileen lean towards the other one towards just like a bubble or some situation like that where it\u2019s just you\u2019re able to push, but then you know I like the idea as well, but you know that transcript when you can like read, I guess you can still get a transcript later right you can still get a transcript later, but even in the car, I found myself in the conversation sometimes even my behavior I found myself scrolling up to read some of the stuff we talked about before and to see like what I said and what it said and I was reflecting on what the AI said so I think and I think because of my my usage I would leave it as like chat bubbles, you know and that back-and-forth because because of that because sometimes that insight is power so powerful that it\u2019s like yeah I need I need it I want it yeah and I guess you know one of the things that I wanted to balance is you know that the conversation back-and-forth cause this is gonna be the thing with the prompting I mean this the main thing here is gonna be the prompting it\u2019s gonna be the most important thing it\u2019s like figuring out how to you know number one we have to start the conversation and we gotta start pre-naturally, probably from from the outside we wanna start something and we wanna get the user to you know to in the divulge to talk to talk right and then from there we probably need more information but at some point we wanna start giving some insight so we may be able to do that immediately oh that sounds like this type of pattern but let me let me hear more about what\u2019s going on like, have you had another situation in life like this you know is there something else going on you know or even hey you know it sounds like you know you know it sounds like this but at the same time it seems like you\u2019re hiding something or you may not be giving me the full story but you know it\u2019s like it\u2019s like challenging and it\u2019s like it\u2019s really man. We\u2019re really looking for human like behavior here. It\u2019s like you can see you can see it\u2019s like you kind of you\u2019re flexible to go anyway depending on the user and what they\u2019re saying, whether you get more information or whether you kind move to a place where we\u2019re going into like not necessarily solution but like a pattern, you know where you\u2019re going to some sort of understanding phase where you\u2019re like trying to like presenting what you think and then getting the users feedback on what you think they\u2019re going through and how you how your kind of defining what you\u2019ve heard so far and seeing if the user kind of agrees with that offer, I mean for me that was the point where I was like holy shit this thing really understands me and that could be really powerful moment and I don\u2019t necessarily want that part broken up a ton with you know clarifying questions or like verification questions but there is a value to it so it\u2019s a balance and then ultimately of course we need to lead the conversation to an end probably within 30 minutes to an hour right you know it has to it\u2019s kind of close out with some action items with some lessons with some patterns with some things to go forward for the week you know it it has to wrap up consistently, you know and one of the things you know in general is that you know sometimes people don\u2019t have the full-time you know some people that sometimes you just hop in and you know you just you want to look kind of brain down something and then that\u2019s it and maybe maybe that\u2019s a button you know what I mean it\u2019s like it\u2019s like a dump. Maybe it\u2019s like a butt. It\u2019s a you know it\u2019s a button or it\u2019s a setting or a thing that you could just press and say like hey I\u2019m just like recording this dump and I want just you know and I want a response. I do wanna response but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m not gonna go back-and-forth a bunch you know, but I don\u2019t know what that means. I don\u2019t know what that looks like exactly but just something where it\u2019s like cause often I just hop in and I\u2019m like I\u2019m only planning on recording really one dump and seeing what the response are is and then seeing kind of the results in the video of my patterns and just seeing the update and then you know, I\u2019m only planning on really sending one maybe two things and then maybe later on the evening I wanna go back-and-forth on a specific topic but like sometimes I just wanna dump and then for that that should be a thing because at the same time you know it doesn\u2019t you know if the AI is asking like well tell me a little bit more about that you know it\u2019s like that doesn\u2019t that\u2019s not relevant you just I just wanna see the patterns. I just wanna see the thing so I can just immediately maybe I am having a situation in the moment and I need to see the breakdown. It\u2019s like then we need to do you know what I mean you know and I need to see the breakdown immediately because I have a situation right there and I need to see OK I\u2019m having situation right now. What patterns you know I think I know what patterns it is you know what to do but I just want another opinion, but we just need that. We just need that you know what I mean and maybe that is like the emergency kind of emergency protocol but it\u2019s not really that it\u2019s something else kinda like a dump mode or just you know like one response or one shot I don\u2019t know what you wanna call one shot motor you know and that\u2019s kind of a different thing than like a whole daily reflection or a daily log or something like that like a back-and-forth like there\u2019s probably a couple different modes. It\u2019s probably really more. It\u2019s probably you know but it\u2019s like at least two modes one is like hey this kinda like a dump one shot and then you know that\u2019s where we\u2019re just like boom quick you know dump one shot seeing what\u2019s going on and moving and then there\u2019s one more it\u2019s like we\u2019re really gonna be working through something we\u2019re gonna get an idea and and then we\u2019re gonna talk about stuff and that\u2019s a different thing"

Because, I mean, one of the main things is that quick I mean, for both modes, you do need probably text input. Just like maybe for a quick TTS. You know, where you're able to just, like, press a button and just record something or you're able to just type something. You need that so we'll probably need the chat bubbles in general. But yeah. But I like the I like the, like your thoughts about it because it does make sense. But again, I mean, even when I'm doing a quick dump or something, I still want to sometimes I mean, I just wanna I just wanna read the I just wanna see the things, and I'm not I'm not gonna be listening. And what I do find is that a lot of people often aren't able to listen to stuff, you know. They have to read it. So Yeah. Also, I noticed we didn't go over everything because I I went over a bunch of stuff with the girl. Can you just analyze and look at that stuff real quick? Just wanna know that you saw it. There's a lot of stuff there, and I'm interested in your perspective on Yeah. So let's get your perspective on that fleshed out, and then let's for this side, let's let's just go with chat bubbles because it makes more sense. But let's talk about that kind of those 2 different modes. Like, how would those even be you know, is that a switch? You know, is that just a quick switch somewhere that's just like boom, click it, and then it's like know, we're in a we're in a different mode, and then we're moving? Pattern racket. Yeah. Well, I mean, I guess, you okay. And then the next steps, I guess. Yeah. Let's do the 1, 3 1, 2, and 3. I don't know if the prompt is necessarily, like, crazy different because we talked about the prompt that we used for, like, basically for this chat I mean, it was really simple. It was just like act like a cognitive behavioral therapist. Right? Something like that. But know, we ended up with this crazy thing, but you are the state of the art art model, so it's like know, you're probably a little bit better than know, maybe a cheaper thing. And then, yeah, we do need specific UI flows for it's not necessarily, like, crazy different probably but it's probably what I can because I can see on the side, basically. I could see on, like, maybe the right side of screen or on the top side of this like, on the right side, maybe we have, like, the you know, Some some stuff, like, I don't know, a streak thing or a log thing or, you know, I don't know. I don't know what the I don't know. Also, I don't want it to be, like, super like, there's 2 toolbars. It's a bunch of shit. Obviously, everything's collapsible to have just the central thing But it could also be, like, kind of a smart you know, a smart window in a way. Know, where there's, like, you know, stuff on it in, you know, even attached to the to attached to the messages, like, I don't know. That's even that's a crazy idea. I do like that though. If the you know, because right now we have emotions attached to the messages. But it'd be interesting if we, like, you know, attached tasks the message in a way Like, we identified you know, say we identified a pattern and then, like, so boom. You know, we would attach know, insights and we'd be like, this is associated with this pattern. You know, we're like, something like that. I don't know. That's a random idea, but, yeah, let's flesh out, the thing a little bit, and then I can get back to work a little bit. But, by the way, I I am interested in your perspective on the girl stuff.

I want to know your opinion on it.\n Personally for me it is fine to be friends with you only\nSimon Jackson: busy work new contacts after the conference\n(\ud83d\udc4c 1)\nSimon Jackson: focused on that\nRegina: \ud83c\udfa4 [Voice Note]\nRegina: It is confusing cause you didn't answer the question, but anyway. You're ok? \nWanna hangout like friends on the weekend? I will learn some stuff and also I am curious about you doing things (I mean AI and research). Can also give my opinion on your life situation if it's appropriate\nRegina: \ud83c\udfa5 [Video] Lol, I hope you will answer before Monday\n\nI'm trying to figure out why I hate these messages because they're very triggering to me. She messaged me a couple days ago today is I forgot to I don't think I forgot to respond. I think I read the message and then I decided to not address it in the momen because it's I mean it's a similar vibe. I mean it's like it's like when I see if I see something that I should've taken care of a long time ago, but I didn't and then I got triggered by it re-triggered by it. I didn't masturbate by the way I did keep trucking, but I ended up taking another break probably about an hour and I just watched some bullshit. Kind of like fake napped on the couch and now I'm back to work, but yeah I just kind of a sugared again by these mess. I was just thinking I just remembered like I didn't respond and I was like fuck I should probably respond, but I was thinking about it and I was like fuck I what I wanna say and I guess maybe I should say it because that would be authentic maybe but what I wanna say is I hate your style of communication. I hate it probably because if I was going to communicate with humans about I don't know it's like the worst. This is how I communicate probably with AI in a way maybe you can tell me I mean, do I communicate like this with you like I don't know what it is. I hate it. I hate it. I don't like that. I don't like it. I don't like nobody does this like nobody communicate with me like this I don't und like if if somebody my opinion, I guess I think I'm just gonna spit ball it dude if you want to learn something then do it like that I'm sorry I'm yelling a little bit like if you wanna learn something then do it then learn it and then you could ask questions or do whatever you want you know you can get a perspective you could do anything you want, but I think you know what's frustrating. What frustrates me about it is like I see myself in this and I hate. I hate that side of me. I hate it. I hate the side of me. I hate it that I hate hate. Hate it that side that's tip towing around bullshit that's not. That's the side. That's not doing shit the side that's fucking you know honestly decide that I hate you know this decide that will sit certain waste you know wasting hour watching YouTube and I know I said I wouldn't judge myself for it and I'm trying to not. I'm trying not to. I'm chilling but like it's that you know what I mean it's I don't. I hate that side and maybe I can make peace with that. I can make peace with that side of myself but fuck me I mean, I just something about these messages dude you know what I mean. I don't communicate with people like this. It's like a fifth grade thing or something. Hey do you wanna be friends no bitch I don't wanna be fucking friends do you know what I mean? I don't like if you ask me a quite like and by the way, I don't know like if somebody else I don't know I can't even test this cause nobody else acts like this nobody else like behaves this way like hey do you wanna be friends? Hey do you want it like I hate it I hate it. I hate it. I can't pisses me off. I guess I wanna fucking throw my phone. I wanna respond with something mean what I wanna say is I hate your style of communication it's the worst. It makes me feel like we're in third grade. I hate it. I don't like to have. I don't want to upfront fucking discuss this this type of shit just I don't wanna talk about being friends or just I don't care. I don't want it. I don't want it. Leave it dead it keep it dead fucking everything is dead and leave it dead OK and if you need something else, then you can get something else. Ask about some other bullshit show up if you just show up and then I don't care honestly if you just show up and you're working on something cool and then you're like hey what's the thing? OK that's cool. I'm interested you know you're working on something cool in your you know you're grinding and OK that's fine but to fucking like the plan bro just show up just do it or just like hey I'm I'm gonna be working on something this weekend like I don't know this isn't that though I don't I feel like this is like maybe I think I'm nitpicking. I think I am but I might not be I feel like I just hate it and I don't know. I feel like I should just did this. I should get it. I should just say listen I hate your style of communication. I just I'm not interested. I'm just not interested. Yeah I'm sorry sucks. I'm not interested like for some reason. Something about your style of communication. I hate it. It triggers me and I want it I want out I want out, but maybe this is me resetting and quitting again. I mean I've known the score for a little bit. I mean, I don't really care. I mean, I guess if she died, I would care but like I don't know.",

I want to know your opinion on it.\n Personally for me it is fine to be friends with you only\nSimon Jackson: busy work new contacts after the conference\n(\ud83d\udc4c 1)\nSimon Jackson: focused on that\nRegina: \ud83c\udfa4 [Voice Note]\nRegina: It is confusing cause you didn't answer the question, but anyway. You're ok? \nWanna hangout like friends on the weekend? I will learn some stuff and also I am curious about you doing things (I mean AI and research). Can also give my opinion on your life situation if it's appropriate\nRegina: \ud83c\udfa5 [Video] Lol, I hope you will answer before Monday\n\nI'm trying to figure out why I hate these messages because they're very triggering to me. She messaged me a couple days ago today is I forgot to I don't think I forgot to respond. I think I read the message and then I decided to not address it in the momen because it's I mean it's a similar vibe. I mean it's like it's like when I see if I see something that I should've taken care of a long time ago, but I didn't and then I got triggered by it re-triggered by it. I didn't masturbate by the way I did keep trucking, but I ended up taking another break probably about an hour and I just watched some bullshit. Kind of like fake napped on the couch and now I'm back to work, but yeah I just kind of a sugared again by these mess. I was just thinking I just remembered like I didn't respond and I was like fuck I should probably respond, but I was thinking about it and I was like fuck I what I wanna say and I guess maybe I should say it because that would be authentic maybe but what I wanna say is I hate your style of communication. I hate it probably because if I was going to communicate with humans about I don't know it's like the worst. This is how I communicate probably with AI in a way maybe you can tell me I mean, do I communicate like this with you like I don't know what it is. I hate it. I hate it. I don't like that. I don't like it. I don't like nobody does this like nobody communicate with me like this I don't und like if if somebody my opinion, I guess I think I'm just gonna spit ball it dude if you want to learn something then do it like that I'm sorry I'm yelling a little bit like if you wanna learn something then do it then learn it and then you could ask questions or do whatever you want you know you can get a perspective you could do anything you want, but I think you know what's frustrating. What frustrates me about it is like I see myself in this and I hate. I hate that side of me. I hate it. I hate the side of me. I hate it that I hate hate. Hate it that side that's tip towing around bullshit that's not. That's the side. That's not doing shit the side that's fucking you know honestly decide that I hate you know this decide that will sit certain waste you know wasting hour watching YouTube and I know I said I wouldn't judge myself for it and I'm trying to not. I'm trying not to. I'm chilling but like it's that you know what I mean it's I don't. I hate that side and maybe I can make peace with that. I can make peace with that side of myself but fuck me I mean, I just something about these messages dude you know what I mean. I don't communicate with people like this. It's like a fifth grade thing or something. Hey do you wanna be friends no bitch I don't wanna be fucking friends do you know what I mean? I don't like if you ask me a quite like and by the way, I don't know like if somebody else I don't know I can't even test this cause nobody else acts like this nobody else like behaves this way like hey do you wanna be friends? Hey do you want it like I hate it I hate it. I hate it. I can't pisses me off. I guess I wanna fucking throw my phone. I wanna respond with something mean what I wanna say is I hate your style of communication it's the worst. It makes me feel like we're in third grade. I hate it. I don't like to have. I don't want to upfront fucking discuss this this type of shit just I don't wanna talk about being friends or just I don't care. I don't want it. I don't want it. Leave it dead it keep it dead fucking everything is dead and leave it dead OK and if you need something else, then you can get something else. Ask about some other bullshit show up if you just show up and then I don't care honestly if you just show up and you're working on something cool and then you're like hey what's the thing? OK that's cool. I'm interested you know you're working on something cool in your you know you're grinding and OK that's fine but to fucking like the plan bro just show up just do it or just like hey I'm I'm gonna be working on something this weekend like I don't know this isn't that though I don't I feel like this is like maybe I think I'm nitpicking. I think I am but I might not be I feel like I just hate it and I don't know. I feel like I should just did this. I should get it. I should just say listen I hate your style of communication. I just I'm not interested. I'm just not interested. Yeah I'm sorry sucks. I'm not interested like for some reason. Something about your style of communication. I hate it. It triggers me and I want it I want out I want out, but maybe this is me resetting and quitting again. I mean I've known the score for a little bit. I mean, I don't really care. I mean, I guess if she died, I would care but like I don't know."

I'm out and so that's it, but I guess in general for the future and we didn't go over this fully butlike is the whole idea here like if I if I meet somebody and they don't is it just is it just I mean we're just being authentic I guess man it's such a weird thing because I don't. I don't feel comfortable like I don't feel comfortable cutting off relationships. I don't feel comfortable moving on. I don't feel comfortable like it feels like throwing a bomb down a fucking you know like a shoot like a bomb down you know it's just but you know so many times in my life. I think I've mentioned a few of those times the time when the girls suck my dick that one time and I know you know and I just like left her you know and there was another time where I was in where I was in Hungary and I met a girl out and we had ended up spending like you know she came back to my apartment. We spent like the whole night together, but it was like all game like games, but it was all teasing and at the time you know my biggest I hated teasing I hated it, and I had a rule like if a girl saw my penis and she didn't have sex with me then I would just then I would never talk to her again and it was like a hard line and it was my hard line because because at the time I was dealing with a lot of there was a lot of potential for being friends zoned or being just let on or dragged on and I just couldn't handle that I didn't want it so I just had this hardline rule which is pretty aggressive, but it was like yeah if you don't fucking yeah if you don't, yeah you see my dick and you don't do anything if you don't touch it if you don't do anything with it then I'm out and that girl you know I ended it. You know I also had a thing where it was like when in doubt whip it out and so you know, she was like grinding on my cock and everything just but at the end, I pulled it out she didn't do anything and then I was like OK cool and when the next day came and she was messaging me at night like I just didn't respond I just didn't respond and I remember I remember she sent me like a message the very end she sent me a few messages but I remember the very end she said my phone she was like Chibuzor you're better than this. You're a good you're a good guy. I think you're better than this or something like that and then that was the last message and I remember that stuck with me and I remember thinking like I really it was kind of shitty to not respond and I guess so. I say that story to say it feels terrible to like you know to tell somebody how you really feel or that you don't wanna spend time with them anymore or that you don't wanna talk anymore that you're not interested it feels terrible, but I guess for that person in the end like it probably feels terrible to not ever hear from you again and not know why or to get that message from you. It's like it's terrible both ways it's just that one way I don't have to experience their pain at all. You know I can just you know I could just block them, but I didn't block her so I did experience her pain to some extent you know by feeling it made me feel bad but in the end like you know, you don't have to actually you're not confronted. You're not confronted with their reaction. You don't have to deal with it and I think I've always ran. I've always I've always you know I've let I've let the situations in my life dictate. What happens I'm in Thailand because that is what the situation. Dictated that I this is where I should be based on the situation, not really based on a conscious like physical decision I mean, of course they decided I'm here because of my decisions, but I didn't decide in a extremely extreme like way that I'm gonna live here. I just went with the flow of the thing and that's how I do and that's how I usually work in general on with a lot of the jobs. It's like I continuing the job until even if my heart started in it it just until the end until I literally get fired. I'm just gonna sit there and like push and try and I'm not really trying at some level of cours I'm doing worse and worse and worse and worse with time but I'm I won't make that decision. I won't force the other person to make that decision and I guess this would be the first this would be one of the first Mann if I don't ship anything today I guess I could ship this of ending a relationship which sounds terrible.

			"text": "Well, it's, 2:40 AM. I'm gonna head home. Man, I don't know what to say. Yeah. I did, I did a part of a tutorial For expo, expo router or expo, you know, expo react native. Mobile framework. I realized I think it was informative in a way because You know, it it kind of reinforced the project structure but holistically speaking, I mean, that that tutorial was definitely higher level. And, and truly, like, you you should know basic React already. With, props and passing things around and Doing all that stuff and, in imports and and that yeah. I don't know that stuff. So I don't think you know, I don't know. You know, with these tutorials, it's kind of it's kind of start you know, they just they kinda it's it's documentation Right? It's not meant to be a tutorial per se. It's more just show you how the document you know, how they do it in the documentation, and then you can kinda maybe Do your own version maybe. So I can't say, I mean, that that took some time, but I know, I just interspersed, watched a couple of videos, you know, we had the, obviously, thing with the girl. Little emotional, whatever. I did message the girl that's coming tomorrow a little bit, or I guess today, she's coming and a few hours. I've been saying. So, yeah, I mean, I'm I'm, I I'll just tell you my honest feeling and then and then, you know, we know, My feeling is I'm a little bit diss I'm pretty disappointed, and, amount of work got actually out I was able to I modified one small thing For the for the main for the business, in Notion, for the affiliate business, just so so I got one Oh, I guess we could do the wins. Yeah. So I got one, you know, that's it was very small, but it was it was it was not nothing. I mean, it was small though. Obviously, we let go of that connection that one girl we were able to message the other one. I You know? I'm I'm still You know, I'm nervous. But it's whatever. My roommate I do have a roommate here. I know I'm old, and I have a roommate I don't know. So I'm I'm gonna head home right now. We do need to communicate about tomorrow because you know, I would like Time alone with the girl, it's one day. So you know, it's one day you know, and I I made know, I was gone for one day when when he had a girl. I stayed in the office, basically. So I think, you know, hope so we should, you know, all communicate, you know, as a possible, you know, stay with a friend for one night just know? Well, I'm with girl she's gonna leave tomorrow. Obviously, it's all good. So I wanna I'm gonna communicate that if he's still awake when I get back. Gonna communicate it now. On text, and then when I get back, you know, communicate further, I did let him borrow some, borrow my card to pull out some money, but ended up he ended up using more than he said. But he said that he was gonna get back to me that people were gonna send money He said the people his people were gonna send money. I was like, okay. But then I noticed, like, you know, I have, like, Android left. So I'm like, k. That's a little riding a little bit close here. What's going on? You know? What? You know, because I don't get paid until, obviously, like, New Year's or really after. Actually, to be honest, I mean, we're really if I think about it, we're kind of on the edge here. Let me look at my account. We're pretty, I I gotta say, yeah, we're pretty uncomfortably Claude. Because I don't get paid yeah. I'll get paid so we have, like, But lucky enough, I mean, is it lucky? Yeah. We have 15 days in the month left You know, it's almost the 12th or 14th or something. I don't know what day it is, but 15 days in the month left, It's 15th, so 16 days of the month left. I won't get obviously, won't get paid until probably, like, you know, so probably up to about 20 days, 20 days divided by I think I have, like, $150 You know, tomorrow is probably gonna be a more expensive day. I'm even gonna you know what I mean? Because, you know, we're gonna you know, each thing that we're gonna do with the girl, it's probably gonna be like 600 baht. You know, we're gonna eat probably, like, a coffee thing. Little food there. Up there would be like 1 to 2,000 baht And then know, we'll go eat with the animals. I don't know. That'll probably be, like, I don't know, 500 baht or something like that. Then we'll go we'll go to a rooftop somewhere, get a couple of drinks. I mean, Let's just go ahead and say 2,000 again. And then we maybe we go to, like, a ping pong show, a couple ping pong shows, which probably be, like, a 1,000 again. So I would say tomorrow you know listen. I mean, it's expensive. Know, the irony is that you could pay for vagina for for 2,000 baht and be done with it. But it's not what we're doing. We're we're experiencing the world. So I'm I'm Semi prepared to I guess I'm prepared to spend around 7,000 baht which is something like $200 tomorrow, spend time with this girl. I do know she has her own money, so she might she probably you know, she's independent as well, so she would Cash here and there. Maybe But I'm gonna try to be a man quote unquote. And, you know, just, You know, she's my guest. You know, and, do that. And it's authentic, I'll add that. You know, if it's the vibe, I guess I mean, it feels, yeah. I mean, I think it's fine. I think it's fine to pay. For a girl. I'm not, like, Fully I think it's fine to pay for a girl overall. We do have a we're gonna have a little bit of work at the end the day at some point. Fuck. Okay. Gotta breathe a little bit. Because I just got a text. It's got my first message. About fucking work for tomorrow. Just fucking Jesus Christ. Motherfuckers starting soon. So we're gonna have a little bit, we're gonna do a little bit Yeah. So it should be a little bit interesting. Yeah. Next week was is gonna be a push. I mean, listen. We have you know, 6 weeks You know, maybe we have the month of February, to make the business go. Gonna Probably Talk and see if we can get the whole month February as well. Anyway sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Well, I'll I'll just be open a little bit Yeah. I guess, the conversation I didn't have it, but that was had without me was that the business that I I own 10% in there's 2 affiliate businesses booked one of them I own 10%. This one they basically The the the guy who's financing it said that, we have until February. Now I don't know if it's, like, the beginning of February or the end of February. I would probably push for the end of February But even then, I'm supposed to go back to the US probably. At the beginning of February. So yeah, I don't know how that's gonna go. Know how everything's gonna go. Is really you know, but, you know, so that's just, you know, You know, next week will be an interesting push because we might try to open up a new kind of business line. With, with media buyers, If we can do that, then that might be a saving grace. If we can't, then it doesn't look good. If I'm being honest, it doesn't look good, but it called trying that\u2019s all we can do. We could just put in a college try that\u2019s all we can do. Yeah I mean all in all don\u2019t love the progress but but you know that\u2019s is the way that it is and you know I do feel like I do know in fact, I know one of the things I mean, I think that i\u2019m ashamed to say it. I\u2019m ashamed to say it I\u2019m ashamed to say it, but you know I have more experience with next JS. I have more experience with setting up the projects. I know that I could probably get something quicker set up in next JS just cause I understand. Listen I don\u2019t understand all the stuff that\u2019s going on, but there\u2019s more pre-components that I understand there than on the mobile side I ashamed to say that cause it\u2019s like well then you would probably say yeah why aren\u2019t you just doing next JS like that\u2019s the shortest path why are you doing the mobile thing you know why are you trying to be perfect? Make that you know, and I would say you know and this is I don\u2019t know. I feel like this is part of my thing. It\u2019s like I hold. I hold my my secrets. It\u2019s my thing. It\u2019s my knowledge I know like I know like I know something I don\u2019t know something. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll know a better way or I\u2019ll know. I should be doing something one way. I know I know it I know that I should do it a simple way OK and but yet I want to keep the information to myself that I know I can do it a simple way I want to keep that to myself because I want to do the I want the mountain I want the thing that is like just a little bit beyond when I\u2019m capable of or what I think I can do. I just I want that thing and then when I can\u2019t get it, you know, I\u2019m obviously disappointed a little bit and I know you\u2019re gonna say it\u2019s part of the cycle, but I\u2019ll I\u2019ll I\u2019ll submit. I\u2019ll submit to your pattern recognition I think yeah obviously I see that that is part of the cycle, which is like something like perfection reach for the stars. Fall short get depressed restart get inspired reach for the stars way too far overshoot Icarus wings fall to the Earth die get back up again and repeat or something like that and then so there\u2019s like a few. It\u2019s probably a few cycles going on and we\u2019ve gone through them a bunch but we can look at them again. I guess we can look at them again, but yeah I mean all in all I mean today you mean we had a breakthrough today that that\u2019s something it\u2019s not nothing. I do always feel like you know one step forward and then you know kind of the same place for everything else, but I guess it counts for something man not much. It feels like not much cause I still have like clothing. You know what it is. It\u2019s just it feels like there\u2019s too many open loops. There\u2019s too many open loops at the moment you know and and and in the Opal loops like really fucking arc you know that where IRK the arc and so yeah I gotta get them like I mean the biggest loop of all is that I don\u2019t know how to code and then I\u2019m relying on this tool to help me I mean that\u2019s the biggest loop of all but then the second big loop is that the biggest the big open loop is that you know I literally you know the fabric stuff it\u2019s the clothing stuff I literally have fabric and two different places with people waiting for me to tell them what to do with the fabric and you know it\u2019s been a while. It\u2019s been like a month since I communicated two months and it\u2019s just bad. It\u2019s just bad behavior. Everything is bad and it\u2019s just bad behavior you know at the end. I should just get the fabric shipped to Thailand and just sit on it until I can do something with it but that\u2019s painful. That\u2019s feels like giving up you know cause like how much effort is it to just fucking hate like we\u2019re doing this ship it here make the shirts like you know what I mean it\u2019s not that fucking hard right hey, I\u2019m shipping you fabric. We\u2019re gonna make 20 shirts out of it like we\u2019re done like that\u2019s it. Do you know what I mean so I\u2019m gonna I don\u2019t know like I need somebody to like. Beat me over the fucking head and just to do to do it you know my biggest dream is to have you know the irony you know my dream is you know I always dreamed of being in like the Navy seals or or or even a an actual slave you know because there\u2019s something about having your life and I know you\u2019re gonna bring up control it\u2019s like I wanna have complete control but it\u2019s like to have your life just planned out. Everything is done and by the way that sounds horrible. It\u2019s miserable Terrible and horrible but at least you have like your purpose or your exact thing you know at least you have your exact thing and then maybe afterwards after a while you can get your you know you can wheeled the discipline that you gained towards something else but I guess it\u2019s obviously too late for that but man, if I could pay somebody to just like harass me you know harass me like actually be a fucking annoying piece of shit and honestly that girl was willing to that girl that I just told to that I didn\u2019t want a relationship with her at all you know the thing about her was that I hate to let it go. I hated to let it go because in the end or at the beginning or in the middle I don\u2019t know how you wanna phrase it like she is an asset. She\u2019s an asset. She\u2019s kind of smart. She, she was kind of willing to participate in the things that I wanted to do you know she wanted to learn some of the AI stuff she wanted to participate in some of the companies that I\u2019m in, she was even you know insightful in that she was you know on a trip with some of my coworkers and she was able to tell me like hey you know some of them were talking about you behind your back a little bit so you might wanna kind of watch and that\u2019s an interesting thing to know I mean it\u2019s so I mean she was an interesting you know I guess but you know I just I can\u2019t look past you know why I can\u2019t look past that that you know I don\u2019t know if you know I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s her level of attractiveness I mean it\u2019s gotta be like something like hard level of attractiveness. I mean she had a good body she did decent vagina but yeah it\u2019s got it. I mean it was obviously we talked about you know that the demeanor and the way of being but it wasn\u2019t just that I mean I think it was. I just didn\u2019t like looking at her sometimes at her face from being honest anyway I guess I need to get I don\u2019t know maybe yeah I guess I need I don\u2019t know man it\u2019s kind of weird to talk for so long. I just talked for like 30 minutes, but I guess I need this you know feels like I guess it\u2019s good to get get it out you know so so we have something tomorrow maybe I\u2019ll take the girl to the office now I would be nervous to play some songs some bullshit. I probably won\u2019t play some songs. I probably won\u2019t do that but she seems to enjoy my Tom foolery and soI can only do my best to stay present. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll do tomorrow. Yeah I don\u2019t know what else you know I\u2019m yeah I guess I don\u2019t feel great raw, but it is what it is.",

					"text": "Well, it's, 2:40 AM. I'm gonna head home. Man, I don't know what to say. Yeah. I did, I did a part of a tutorial For expo, expo router or expo, you know, expo react native. Mobile framework. I realized I think it was informative in a way because You know, it it kind of reinforced the project structure but holistically speaking, I mean, that that tutorial was definitely higher level. And, and truly, like, you you should know basic React already. With, props and passing things around and Doing all that stuff and, in imports and and that yeah. I don't know that stuff. So I don't think you know, I don't know. You know, with these tutorials, it's kind of it's kind of start you know, they just they kinda it's it's documentation Right? It's not meant to be a tutorial per se. It's more just show you how the document you know, how they do it in the documentation, and then you can kinda maybe Do your own version maybe. So I can't say, I mean, that that took some time, but I know, I just interspersed, watched a couple of videos, you know, we had the, obviously, thing with the girl. Little emotional, whatever. I did message the girl that's coming tomorrow a little bit, or I guess today, she's coming and a few hours. I've been saying. So, yeah, I mean, I'm I'm, I I'll just tell you my honest feeling and then and then, you know, we know, My feeling is I'm a little bit diss I'm pretty disappointed, and, amount of work got actually out I was able to I modified one small thing For the for the main for the business, in Notion, for the affiliate business, just so so I got one Oh, I guess we could do the wins. Yeah. So I got one, you know, that's it was very small, but it was it was it was not nothing. I mean, it was small though. Obviously, we let go of that connection that one girl we were able to message the other one. I You know? I'm I'm still You know, I'm nervous. But it's whatever. My roommate I do have a roommate here. I know I'm old, and I have a roommate I don't know. So I'm I'm gonna head home right now. We do need to communicate about tomorrow because you know, I would like Time alone with the girl, it's one day. So you know, it's one day you know, and I I made know, I was gone for one day when when he had a girl. I stayed in the office, basically. So I think, you know, hope so we should, you know, all communicate, you know, as a possible, you know, stay with a friend for one night just know? Well, I'm with girl she's gonna leave tomorrow. Obviously, it's all good. So I wanna I'm gonna communicate that if he's still awake when I get back. Gonna communicate it now. On text, and then when I get back, you know, communicate further, I did let him borrow some, borrow my card to pull out some money, but ended up he ended up using more than he said. But he said that he was gonna get back to me that people were gonna send money He said the people his people were gonna send money. I was like, okay. But then I noticed, like, you know, I have, like, Android left. So I'm like, k. That's a little riding a little bit close here. What's going on? You know? What? You know, because I don't get paid until, obviously, like, New Year's or really after. Actually, to be honest, I mean, we're really if I think about it, we're kind of on the edge here. Let me look at my account. We're pretty, I I gotta say, yeah, we're pretty uncomfortably Claude. Because I don't get paid yeah. I'll get paid so we have, like, But lucky enough, I mean, is it lucky? Yeah. We have 15 days in the month left You know, it's almost the 12th or 14th or something. I don't know what day it is, but 15 days in the month left, It's 15th, so 16 days of the month left. I won't get obviously, won't get paid until probably, like, you know, so probably up to about 20 days, 20 days divided by I think I have, like, $150 You know, tomorrow is probably gonna be a more expensive day. I'm even gonna you know what I mean? Because, you know, we're gonna you know, each thing that we're gonna do with the girl, it's probably gonna be like 600 baht. You know, we're gonna eat probably, like, a coffee thing. Little food there. Up there would be like 1 to 2,000 baht And then know, we'll go eat with the animals. I don't know.

Know simpler path (Next.js)\n2. Choose harder path (Expo/mobile)\n3. Struggle with basics\n4. Get disappointed\n5. Consider restart\n\nCONTROL PARADOX:\nWant:\n- Complete structure (Navy SEALs fantasy)\n- External discipline\n- Someone to \"harass\" you\n\nBut Also:\n- Resist available structure\n- Reject accountability (the girl)\n- Keep \"secrets\" about easier paths\n```\n\nThe \"Open Loops\" you mentioned:\n```\nACTIVE TENSIONS:\n1. Technical\n   - Can't code \"properly\"\n   - Relying on tools\n   - Know easier path but resist\n\n2. Business\n   - Fabric waiting\n   - People waiting\n   - Simple solutions available but resist\n\n3. Personal\n   - Roommate situation\n   - Tomorrow's date\n   - Business uncertainty\n```\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Create a specific plan for managing tomorrow with present awareness?\n2. Design a system for closing these open loops one at a time?\n3. Work on accepting \"good enough\" solutions?\n\nRemember: The Navy SEAL fantasy is about wanting structure without having to choose it. The harder path isn't always the more authentic one."

Dashboard (Main View)**\n- Top Row (Quick Status):\n  - Today's check-in status + Quick check-in button\n  - Current streak counter\n  - Emergency Protocol button (always accessible)\n- Middle Row:\n  - Daily check-in form (if not completed)\n  - Or summary of today's entry (if completed)\n- Bottom Row:\n  - Recent activity/logs\n  - Quick patterns noticed\n\n**2. Emergency Protocol Flow**\nWhen \"I Need Help Now\" is pressed:\n1. Immediate overlay with breathing exercise (3 seconds)\n2. Then shows:\n   - 24-hour countdown timer\n   - Warning signs checklist\n   - Action steps:\n     ```\n     1. Write down exactly what you want to change/reset\n     2. Review your recent wins\n     3. Contact accountability partner\n     4. Set a 24-hour waiting period\n     5. Schedule a review time\n     ```\n   - Quick journaling area\n   - \"I'm feeling better\" button\n\n**3. Daily Log Flow**\nMore relaxed daily maintenance:\n- Three small wins\n- Mood tracker\n- Simple checkboxes:\n  - Had urge to reset? (Y/N)\n  - Used any tools/protocols? (Y/N)\n- Optional note\n- Shows up on dashboard until completed\n\n**4. Progress View**\n- Streak visualization\n- Pattern recognition:\n  - Days when reset urge was strongest\n  - Most successful interventions\n  - Longest streaks\n- Recent emergency protocol uses and outcomes\n\nWould you like me to create the Emergency Protocol overlay component next? Or would you prefer to focus on implementing the dashboard with the basic daily check-in first?\n\nThe idea is that the dashboard is your home base with everything accessible, but the Emergency Protocol is an immediate intervention tool that can be accessed anytime, while the daily log is more about maintenance and tracking.",

Dashboard (Main View)**\n- Top Row (Quick Status):\n  - Today's check-in status + Quick check-in button\n  - Current streak counter\n  - Emergency Protocol button (always accessible)\n- Middle Row:\n  - Daily check-in form (if not completed)\n  - Or summary of today's entry (if completed)\n- Bottom Row:\n  - Recent activity/logs\n  - Quick patterns noticed\n\n**2. Emergency Protocol Flow**\nWhen \"I Need Help Now\" is pressed:\n1. Immediate overlay with breathing exercise (3 seconds)\n2. Then shows:\n   - 24-hour countdown timer\n   - Warning signs checklist\n   - Action steps:\n     ```\n     1. Write down exactly what you want to change/reset\n     2. Review your recent wins\n     3. Contact accountability partner\n     4. Set a 24-hour waiting period\n     5. Schedule a review time\n     ```\n   - Quick journaling area\n   - \"I'm feeling better\" button\n\n**3. Daily Log Flow**\nMore relaxed daily maintenance:\n- Three small wins\n- Mood tracker\n- Simple checkboxes:\n  - Had urge to reset? (Y/N)\n  - Used any tools/protocols? (Y/N)\n- Optional note\n- Shows up on dashboard until completed\n\n**4. Progress View**\n- Streak visualization\n- Pattern recognition:\n  - Days when reset urge was strongest\n  - Most successful interventions\n  - Longest streaks\n- Recent emergency protocol uses and outcomes\n\nWould you like me to create the Emergency Protocol overlay component next? Or would you prefer to focus on implementing the dashboard with the basic daily check-in first?\n\nThe idea is that the dashboard is your home base with everything accessible, but the Emergency Protocol is an immediate intervention tool that can be accessed anytime, while the daily log is more about maintenance and tracking."

			"text": "I\u2019m back - been a week or so since this. I had another date or if you wanna call it a date I had to hang out with a girl we met at night and we basically spent a few hours together like dancing and we got some food and we made out and walked around and it was really a beautiful time And we were out till like 6 AM and it was so cool. I really really enjoyed it. Now the reason I\u2019m in this chat right now is because that she is not responding. You know it\u2019s been like you know she went to sleep. Allegedly at like like at 6 AM it\u2019s 7 PM now I sent a few messages. I sent a good morning message And then I sent like a you know potential itinerary for like hanging out in the daytime and no response so I was considering sending this message and but I think it\u2019s a little bit desperate but I wanna send something to kinda like close out this and I think you know I mean the other part is I mean it might be like a little bit Forward or like jumping the shark you know but like she\u2019s definitely awake right now right you know who sleeps for that long no one does like if she\u2019s dead I don\u2019t know like you know so I\u2019m a little bit. It\u2019s fine. I guess overall you know I think I\u2019m blocking some Felix to be honest. I am sad. I\u2019m sad about It. You know it really sucks. Really sucks to like I don\u2019t know, man I\u2019ve been I\u2019ve been trying for the last like I don\u2019t know I had like two dates in the past like couple weeks and it\u2019s just like it just feels like I just feels like I\u2019m not accepted for being myself. You know it just feels like I can\u2019t. I have to Try harder to be like a more aggressive person like I just have to do a lot more shit and I don\u2019t wanna do it. I don\u2019t wanna be a more aggressive person. I just wanna do what I wanna do but at the end of the day it seems like whatever I wanna do is not the fucking thing that works like what actually works is being fucking aggressive. What actually works is fucking like when the girl says at the end of the night that she doesn\u2019t wanna have sex? It\u2019s like OK then you make up an excuse and you find a way to get into a room, regardless of whatever she says with her mouth, but I don\u2019t want to be that type of dude I don\u2019t wanna be that type of guy, but I have to be like Anytime I\u2019ve ever gotten any sort of result in my life is because I was somebody who is pushing way more in that direction and I don\u2019t wanna do that I would rather treat girls with respect. I would rather you know if I call it like that if I would rather like take them out to eat I would rather like you know go out on walks with them. I would rather look them in the eyes and make out with them for three days in a row and then you know sleep with them after five months like two months like I would rather do all that stuff but then at the end of the fucking day I understand that what actually gets results is a person that\u2019s confident and forward with everything and not even confident and forward, but you understand that you have to play the fucking game that you have to play so you have to do the things you have to do you have to make up an excuse you have to you have to give her reasons to allow yourself to sleep with you you have to do way more than you can\u2019t just sit here and be a nice person if I wanna call it like that, it\u2019s I freeze it that way because that\u2019s my social conditioning speaking like a nice boy I wanna be a respectful guy at the end of the day in my teachings in my understanding of the world which is you know I constantly go back I revert back to this other version because that\u2019s just what I would prefer. I would prefer the world to be this a place where I can just where I can just express myself the way I want and I can treat girls the way I want, which is nice. I wanna be a Disney boy. I wanna be lovely but at the end of the fucking day it seems like And then this is just true. It feels like it\u2019s just true and I\u2019m interested in your perspective. it\u2019s just like I can\u2019t do it like that. It\u2019s just not reasonable. It\u2019s not scientific. It\u2019s not smart you are. I am like I am. I am insane. I\u2019m just doing the same things over and over again, knowing that they don\u2019t work knowing the result on the other end, knowing what happens if I tiptoe, knowing what happens if I\u2019m not forward knowing what happens if I don\u2019t set up a context where I can go back to her place or she can come back to my place knowing that if I don\u2019t set these things up in advance, nothing is going to fucking happen. It\u2019s just going to disappear and I know and I know what you might say. I know you might say it like not all girls are like that maybe there\u2019s some girls that are like this like that. It depends on where you\u2019re meeting them and you met this girl at nighttime so of course you met her at the club so of course she\u2019s gonna be this type of girl but and I understand that you\u2019re gonna say that, but I also I dis Aza\u00f1a Sjafri I fucking disagree. I feel like it\u2019s all I think it\u2019s all in a while. You can while there\u2019s some girls who who who need that extra space that need the extra time I think my feeling it\u2019s like it\u2019s this world and this is the difficulty. This is the thing with the social situation and this is you know I\u2019ve rejected it because you know I\u2019ve said that I am you know and this is the honest thing I say that I\u2019m not interested in relationships with women I say that I\u2019m not interested in going out and talking to these girls, but I think the honest thing is that I don\u2019t like sucking at this thing I suck fucking I suck ass at doing this right now and I was better before and it sucks that I used to be \u201c\u201c good and now I\u2019m \u201c\u201c bad and I can\u2019t get the result that I would like and it\u2019s extremely frustrating and as a result, I think my brain is concocted this thing the safety thing of I just don\u2019t want to interact with women where we\u2019re at the end of the fucking day I do and enjoy interacting. I do enjoy kissing. I do enjoy looking into their eyes. I do enjoy sleeping with them. I do enjoy the process. I do enjoy the game. It\u2019s a fact I enjoy these things and yet I\u2019m rejecting them and I think I\u2019m rejecting it because I suck at it and I\u2019m seeing that now after these two dates it\u2019s like I\u2019m I\u2019m excusing all this shit when the other day the Reason I\u2019m avoiding is because I suck that\u2019s it. It\u2019s just the same reason I\u2019m avoiding dancing or tango or Bachata is cause I suck and if I go to those places and I try to dance, I suck and it makes me feel bad so I just wanna avoid those bad, fucking Felix you know and so I don\u2019t know. I guess this is bigger than the text. You know you know this is first of all you know, how do I respond you know I do want some fucking closure but I know the fucking answer but I still wanna send this goddamn message and I want a better way to send this fucking message so take a look at the message and then let\u2019s talk about the rest of this thing cause I mean, I\u2019m that you probably can\u2019t hear my tone because obviously it\u2019s being typed out by text to speech you know or speech to text so you can\u2019t understand my tone, but maybe you can understand my tone is from the words that I\u2019m saying \u2018 cause I\u2019m extremely frustrated extremely annoyed and I know the right way I know the right way and you know the thing The irony and the frustration of the idea of knowing the correct thing to do. This is the thing and this is the thing that\u2019s happened a few times and it\u2019s happening a few places in life where I will say that I know what is going on and it\u2019s like with content, for example with making YouTube videos and Instagram videos, I can talk game I can talk the whole thing what to do what not to do how to make the videos I could do all this stuff and yet you know my friends comes to me and they\u2019re like do they have music they wanna promote I can tell them all the stuff to do and yet for me, I now have really good songs that I can promote. I now have really good videos and really good clothing that I can promote even some software I can promote and yet I\u2019m not doing those things. I know what to do to create clothing and yet I\u2019m not creating the clothing that I need to create. I\u2019m not communicating with the suppliers in the way that I need to communicate why I don\u2019t understand end with women. OK I know what I need to say. I just described to you in my opinion the optimal way to interact with a woman all the way up until the end, you set up the fucking context that you need to do and then you give her an excuse to participate in the activities that you can that you can do and if she doesn\u2019t want to participate, then that\u2019s fine but you have to set up all the context to give her the actual decision and or the plausible deniability to engage or not engage and I did not set any of that up in this girl probably wanted to have sex. She probably wanted to engage with me that night. It might\u2019ve been a one night stand or it might\u2019ve been something that would\u2019ve continued into the future, but I did not set up anything in advance. I didn\u2019t set up anything and as a result, we just left at the end of the day with me wandering close to our apartment hoping That she\u2019s you know gonna take the lead and let me in when it\u2019s like what the fuck we didn\u2019t set up anything and she\u2019s probably not this type of you know she\u2019s the type of liberal type of girl. She probably wants to fuck but I did not set up fucking shit to do any of that so it\u2019s like I know all that stuff and I can I can tell somebody and I can even teach it and yet for whatever godforsaken reason I\u2019m not doing the things that I know I need to do. I\u2019m not studying the way that I\u2019m just study. I\u2019m not I\u2019m not I\u2019m not engaging in projects the way that I need to engage in projects why for the love of God I can\u2019t understand why I keep doing things the exact same way even though I have the understanding of what to do Lord, please help me with this. I just I need help with this. I I feel weird like you know talking to the AI like fucking help me like please please please please please help me. I don\u2019t know what to do. it\u2019s like it\u2019s a low moment right now. It\u2019s like I need help. I need help. I cannot do this by myself. I can\u2019t I can\u2019t About to cry a little bit like I just can\u2019t do it by myself. I\u2019ve tried. I\u2019ve tried so many times and I have meditate. I\u2019ve just done so many things and I just can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t do this like I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m I just don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t know why I act the way that I act even though I know all this stuff, why why can\u2019t I stick to a schedule? Why can\u2019t I I do make the content why can I make the music? Why can\u2019t I talk to the girls? Why can\u2019t I have the relationships that I wanna have? I can see things deteriorating around me because I\u2019m not engaging with the world and the way that I know that I should be able to engage with the world Why why am I watching my universe my world dissolve in front of me and I\u2019m powerless to stop it I\u2019m just watching everything crumble and die and it\u2019s for fucking what I\u2019m switching from project to project with. No fucking intent no fucking no no purpose no no thing just finish fucking one thing you know just I have nothing and I\u2019m just watching everything die and it\u2019s almost like OK you know let me let me like the feeling. It\u2019s like OK let me Let everything die and then I can fucking start it over again. That\u2019s like the feeling. It\u2019s just like quit everything one more time and then start over and then maybe you can do it again from scratch again and that\u2019s the way you know the honest part I\u2019ve done that so many times with these projects these little AI projects that I\u2019ve been coding. This is like a microcosm of my life. I start to make this project and I think I know how to create this project and we get deep into the project and we get to a decent point and then we get to a point and something gets hard or something breaks so I don\u2019t know what to do next and then we scrap the whole fucking project and we start over from scratch even though we\u2019ve already outlined the PRD even though we have the tech spec even though we have like fucking 50 to 60% of a prototype though even though we have all these things, I fucking scrap all of it and we start again from scratch, and the evidence is in the fucking dog shit pile of project files in my GitHub folder holy Shit the amount of things that I\u2019ve done. I just man this is bigger than girls is bigger than everything it\u2019s bigger than fucking all of it. It\u2019s just a lifestyle. It\u2019s a whole thing it\u2019s it\u2019s a whole thing and I just need help and the funny part is it started with this text so I\u2019m gonna give you the text that I want to send, and then we can talk about the rest.\n\n\nThe text:\nI really had a nice time and I think you did too, so I\u2019m confused. I\u2019ll leave you alone, I guess just interested in why you\u2019re not interested or why you are ghosting me? All good in general hope you have a good vacation and nice life if I don\u2019t hear back",

I would rather look them in the eyes and make out with them for three days in a row and then you know sleep with them after five months like two months like I would rather do all that stuff but then at the end of the fucking day I understand that what actually gets results is a person that\u2019s confident and forward with everything and not even confident and forward, but you understand that you have to play the fucking game that you have to play so you have to do the things you have to do you have to make up an excuse you have to you have to give her reasons to allow yourself to sleep with you you have to do way more than you can\u2019t just sit here and be a nice person if I wanna call it like that, it\u2019s I freeze it that way because that\u2019s my social conditioning speaking like a nice boy I wanna be a respectful guy at the end of the day in my teachings in my understanding of the world which is you know I constantly go back I revert back to this other version because that\u2019s just what I would prefer. I would prefer the world to be this a place where I can just where I can just express myself the way I want and I can treat girls the way I want, which is nice. I wanna be a Disney boy. I wanna be lovely but at the end of the fucking day it seems like And then this is just true. It feels like it\u2019s just true and I\u2019m interested in your perspective. it\u2019s just like I can\u2019t do it like that. It\u2019s just not reasonable. It\u2019s not scientific. It\u2019s not smart you are. I am like I am. I am insane. I\u2019m just doing the same things over and over again, knowing that they don\u2019t work knowing the result on the other end, knowing what happens if I tiptoe, knowing what happens if I\u2019m not forward knowing what happens if I don\u2019t set up a context where I can go back to her place or she can come back to my place knowing that if I don\u2019t set these things up in advance, nothing is going to fucking happen. It\u2019s just going to disappear and I know and I know what you might say. I know you might say it like not all girls are like that maybe there\u2019s some girls that are like this like that. It depends on where you\u2019re meeting them and you met this girl at nighttime so of course you met her at the club so of course she\u2019s gonna be this type of girl but and I understand that you\u2019re gonna say that, but I also I dis Aza\u00f1a Sjafri I fucking disagree. I feel like it\u2019s all I think it\u2019s all in a while. You can while there\u2019s some girls who who who need that extra space that need the extra time I think my feeling it\u2019s like it\u2019s this world and this is the difficulty. This is the thing with the social situation and this is you know I\u2019ve rejected it because you know I\u2019ve said that I am you know and this is the honest thing I say that I\u2019m not interested in relationships with women I say that I\u2019m not interested in going out and talking to these girls, but I think the honest thing is that I don\u2019t like sucking at this thing I suck fucking I suck ass at doing this right now and I was better before and it sucks that I used to be \u201c\u201c good and now I\u2019m \u201c\u201c bad and I can\u2019t get the result that I would like and it\u2019s extremely frustrating and as a result, I think my brain is concocted this thing the safety thing of I just don\u2019t want to interact with women where we\u2019re at the end of the fucking day I do and enjoy interacting. I do enjoy kissing. I do enjoy looking into their eyes. I do enjoy sleeping with them. I do enjoy the process. I do enjoy the game. It\u2019s a fact I enjoy these things and yet I\u2019m rejecting them and I think I\u2019m rejecting it because I suck at it and I\u2019m seeing that now after these two dates it\u2019s like I\u2019m I\u2019m excusing all this shit when the other day the Reason I\u2019m avoiding is because I suck that\u2019s it. It\u2019s just the same reason I\u2019m avoiding dancing or tango or Bachata is cause I suck and if I go to those places and I try to dance, I suck and it makes me feel bad so I just wanna avoid those bad, fucking Felix you know and so I don\u2019t know. I guess this is bigger than the text. You know you know this is first of all you know, how do I respond you know I do want some fucking closure but I know the fucking answer but I still wanna send this goddamn message and I want a better way to send this fucking message so take a look at the message and then let\u2019s talk about the rest of this thing cause I mean, I\u2019m that you probably can\u2019t hear my tone because obviously it\u2019s being typed out by text to speech you know or speech to text so you can\u2019t understand my tone, but maybe you can understand my tone is from the words that I\u2019m saying \u2018 cause I\u2019m extremely frustrated extremely annoyed and I know the right way I know the right way and you know the thing The irony and the frustration of the idea of knowing the correct thing to do. This is the thing and this is the thing that\u2019s happened a few times and it\u2019s happening a few places in life where I will say that I know what is going on and it\u2019s like with content, for example with making YouTube videos and Instagram videos, I can talk game I can talk the whole thing what to do what not to do how to make the videos I could do all this stuff and yet you know my friends comes to me and they\u2019re like do they have music they wanna promote I can tell them all the stuff to do and yet for me, I now have really good songs that I can promote. I now have really good videos and really good clothing that I can promote even some software I can promote and yet I\u2019m not doing those things. I know what to do to create clothing and yet I\u2019m not creating the clothing that I need to create. I\u2019m not communicating with the suppliers in the way that I need to communicate why I don\u2019t understand end with women. OK I know what I need to say. I just described to you in my opinion the optimal way to interact with a woman all the way up until the end, you set up the fucking context that you need to do and then you give her an excuse to participate in the activities that you can that you can do and if she doesn\u2019t want to participate, then that\u2019s fine but you have to set up all the context to give her the actual decision and or the plausible deniability to engage or not engage and I did not set any of that up in this girl probably wanted to have sex. She probably wanted to engage with me that night. It might\u2019ve been a one night stand or it might\u2019ve been something that would\u2019ve continued into the future, but I did not set up anything in advance. I didn\u2019t set up anything and as a result, we just left at the end of the day with me wandering close to our apartment hoping That she\u2019s you know gonna take the lead and let me in when it\u2019s like what the fuck we didn\u2019t set up anything and she\u2019s probably not this type of you know she\u2019s the type of liberal type of girl. She probably wants to fuck but I did not set up fucking shit to do any of that so it\u2019s like I know all that stuff and I can I can tell somebody and I can even teach it and yet for whatever godforsaken reason I\u2019m not doing the things that I know I need to do. I\u2019m not studying the way that I\u2019m just study. I\u2019m not I\u2019m not I\u2019m not engaging in projects the way that I need to engage in projects why for the love of God I can\u2019t understand why I keep doing things the exact same way even though I have the understanding of what to do Lord, please help me with this. I just I need help with this. I I feel weird like you know talking to the AI like fucking help me like please please please please please help me. I don\u2019t know what to do. it\u2019s like it\u2019s a low moment right now. It\u2019s like I need help. I need help. I cannot do this by myself. I can\u2019t I can\u2019t About to cry a little bit like I just can\u2019t do it by myself. I\u2019ve tried. I\u2019ve tried so many times and I have meditate. I\u2019ve just done so many things and I just can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t do this like I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m I just don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t know why I act the way that I act even though I know all this stuff, why why can\u2019t I stick to a schedule? Why can\u2019t I I do make the content why can I make the music? Why can\u2019t I talk to the girls? Why can\u2019t I have the relationships that I wanna have? I can see things deteriorating around me because I\u2019m not engaging with the world and the way that I know that I should be able to engage with the world Why why am I watching my universe my world dissolve in front of me and I\u2019m powerless to stop it I\u2019m just watching everything crumble and die and it\u2019s for fucking what I\u2019m switching from project to project with. No fucking intent no fucking no no purpose no no thing just finish fucking one thing you know just I have nothing and I\u2019m just watching everything die and it\u2019s almost like OK you know let me let me like the feeling. It\u2019s like OK let me Let everything die and then I can fucking start it over again. That\u2019s like the feeling. It\u2019s just like quit everything one more time and then start over and then maybe you can do it again from scratch again and that\u2019s the way you know the honest part I\u2019ve done that so many times with these projects these little AI projects that I\u2019ve been coding. This is like a microcosm of my life. I start to make this project and I think I know how to create this project and we get deep into the project and we get to a decent point and then we get to a point and something gets hard or something breaks so I don\u2019t know what to do next and then we scrap the whole fucking project and we start over from scratch even though we\u2019ve already outlined the PRD even though we have the tech spec even though we have like fucking 50 to 60% of a prototype though even though we have all these things, I fucking scrap all of it and we start again from scratch, and the evidence is in the fucking dog shit pile of project files in my GitHub folder holy Shit the amount of things that I\u2019ve done. I just man this is bigger than girls is bigger than everything it\u2019s bigger than fucking all of it. It\u2019s just a lifestyle. It\u2019s a whole thing it\u2019s it\u2019s a whole thing and I just need help and the funny part is it started with this text so I\u2019m gonna give you the text that I want to send, and then we can talk about the rest.\n\n\nThe text:\nI really had a nice time and I think you did too, so I\u2019m confused. I\u2019ll leave you alone, I guess just interested in why you\u2019re not interested or why you are ghosting me? All good in general hope you have a good vacation and nice life if I don\u2019t hear back"

I don't know what that helps or what it will do, but yeah man it's you hit the nail on the fucking head with all this like it's exact it's exact you got exact thing like it's it's everything it's like yeah who I need to be. It's like well I want to be yeah I wanna be a certain thing in and I and I feel like I can't you know it's with email you you just did it exactly with them. You know it goes across all the things you know with dating I wanna just be a nice boy whatever the fuck that means I just wanna be a nice I just wanna go up to people and say something and be kind of funny and be a nerd and I don't wanna I don't wanna like I don't wanna think of what to do in advance. I don't want to craft the play and I don't want to do any of the stuff and in and the girls don't like me enough. It feels like the girls don't girls don't like me enough for me to just and by the way they have in my life but just now it's just like that yeah they don't like me and they like me by the way girls do like me that's the fucking weird part and all of this things and you understand I'm just gonna I'm probably gonna be repeating myself a little bit but girls do like me you know and I am good at making soft if I'm good at making software I'm good at writing stuff. I'm good at creating things. I know my I know my my clothing is cool people like it. People of know I go to these conferences and people like hundreds of people come up and they want pictures and they want photos and they wanna engage with me and so I know I have external validation of all of the stuff. And even with the music, I've shown people some of the music that I've created. I've shown people and it's AI you know, but people have listened to the music that I've created and they like it. They like it and they see the potential they like it and they're waiting for me to put out more stuff every little video that I put out every little thing I get tons of feedback with people like holy shit you're awesome can do more and yet I stopped. I don't know. I stopped because of that that the feel of that you know I feel like we need more of a strategy. I think I need more of a top level strategy all the way down I need to come up with a rollout plan for everything I need better. You know you got it right with the perfectionism it's like why do you know man that's it's perfect like you described it perfectly. It's like I'm experiencing a pattern of self sabotage where I just avoid doing things because I'm afraid of doing them poorly. It's just fucking a perfect way to say it and I don't know where that came from because I didn't have it the whole time I didn't have it. It's just something that manifested over the last four years or so. It's like it started to come. You know when I started making content in in 2021. I was just making stuff and putting stuff out and when I would talk to girls, I would just go out and I would you know suck or be good and I would get some girls or not and it was just freedom. I was just free you know and I had some depression and I had issues, but I was able to just make stuff and put it out and something happened when you know when I start when I went viral it's like you know and you don't have that full context but it's like I went viral on TikTok, I got like I got 17 million views on one video and then several videos with 1,000,000+ views and you know with these different dancing videos and you know the main context of the first video was me living in my office and I got so much validation from it. I fucking was killing the game. I had these live streams that were that were so big that you know again I mean it's all contextual but for me they were so big. It was so big that even TikTok reached out to me and they gave me a TikTok rep and I had like literally a direct line to talk to. You know to talk about things and to make stuff and they would be include me on these these lives you know these weekly round ups of live streams, and stuf and and I have there's a point where I was getting like 1 million you know 1 million views a week more than 1 million views even impressions a day there was a couple days I got 1,500,000 impression a day on my live stream. It was crazy and you know I think that you know the pattern started around then it's like you know we got to that. I don't know what happened in that at that time you know where it wa you know we had those crazy live stream, but it got to a point you know I wasn't making any money OK and that was one of the big things I wasn't making any money and that started to affect me because like I would do this crazy lifestream and I would have all this you know likes and all the stuff happen and and yeah, I wasn't able to pay for like I wasn't able to buy food. I wasn't able to buy the Uber home and I would have you know supporters that would send me money like even just to get home and do different things but it started to affect me like you know and you can't have these kids. You can't keep that up for forever. You know a lot of times you know they'll be up and down up and down with content, but I didn't have money and and the content started to you know on TikTok, especially men you can have any amount of followers. You can have any amount of thing but if you fall out of the algorithm now you're doing 1000 views for for a video 10,000 views for and man that fucking sucks it fucking sucks and then it fucking sucks even more when you're not making any money and you can't afford to even take a girl out you can't afford to even do the job. You know I had enough money to do the job and I feel like and if I would've kept going back then I would be at a different completely different point in life now, but I didn't you know and it's been up and down I don't know like even with the clothing stuff I don't know yeah I think you got it right I think you got it right it's yeah and you you got the thing it's like yeah I'm not bad at it. I'm not bad at anything. I'm good at things. I'm really good. I think I'm really good. I think there's evidence but I I I can't. I don't wanna put out garbage. I see what's good. I see what's good every day when when I scroll on Instagram and when I scroll on YouTube, I see what good is I see good clothes I see good content I see funny people and it's like I can't. You know I see good good music I even on Spotify I hear good music and it's like a YouTube. I hear good music like I can't you know putting out my shitty my thing and it's not shitty but like the idea like putting out my dumb video or my shitty strong like in the fucking thing it's like I don't know I'm gonna get I don't know. I feel like I'm gonna I'm gonna get 1000 views. I don't know what I don't really the actual thing because it's you're hitting something that's like not totally visible to me. It's not totally visible, but it's like I'm gonna post it and and it's gonna suck. No one's gonna care and and no one should care and it will suck it and I need to build it up and I understand those things. I understand that like you need to post for a while you need that you need to try you need to be trying to do things in new verticals and you need to be pushing and and I understand this and yet you know, I'm not I'm not doing those things and I know I'm hatching some of the stuff but I just I think you're it's really helping me. Try to understand like what the fuck is going on here cause I think I think you'I think you're understanding me a little bit more than I understand myself and I think we're starting to find that that spot I'm not gonna send that message. Thank you for that. Yeah, thank you for that but yeah that's a perfect thing. Yeah it's like yeah I don't wanna. I don't wanna behave a certain way with women like you know yeah instead of finding the middle ground, I just don't do it. You know it's just frustrating so I don't do yeah instead of you know and even with coding with coding like it's it's hard to suck you know coding it's hard to not know you know it's a slow process of learning react or learning you know vite** whatever and you know instead of like taking some time and maybe doing the tutorial once a day or twice a day in addition to all the stuff that I'm doing it's like I'd rather just use a an AI Dev thing you know I'd rather just have one of these LLMs code for me and put push the code instead of like learning some stuff myself like really actually actually learning some of the stuff myself you k you know they'll be some extent of just you know again you know I don't need to know a lot to do this, but like I should be, I want to get to a place where I'm a good developer like I wanna be at. I wanna be able to identify as a developer like why not you know how much effort like if I if I took a react course for like a month, I'd probably know all the stuff and I'd be able to really use these AI tools to their fullest extent and yet I'm just dabbling on the outskirts not willing to learn even one thing and I just it's like why and I'll take some fucking time and you know I can. I have kind of a diagnosed of ADHD, but I don't know if I I think that the problem isn't necessarily the ADHD. I think the problem is whatever you just pointed out. I think the part deacon contribute for sure but it's bigger thing. It's the bigger thing cause I I was able to focus on things before in college man you know I remember when I was a freshman and I was able to study for hours on this shit that I didn't care about you know and I was getting these good grades and I would do the same thing every day and I'll go to the library and you know the lifestyle I live right now it's so similar and yet I don't have the results. I don't have the ou that I could that I should in my opinion half I guess and I'm so afraid yeah I just yeah it's and I was talking to the girl yesterday. You know one of the girls that not this girl that we're talking about with that with this text but the other this, she was circling the circling this she was saying I was afraid of failure and I was like I don't know if I am, but it seems like I might be afraid of failure or afraid of maybe not afraid of failure, but I think that that you have it on the head that fear of like I don't I don't wanna do something shitty I want to put out a good thing. I wanna have a thing where people are like oh shit this is fucking amazing and then like you know and it's hard to like create one like even right now you know I have this some software for the for the for the company that I work for for the business that I that I started it's like we really need like three features like three specific things and when you be able to do them well and it's like three things we don't need a whole platform, but it's like I could create those and I have created those individual elements. Those are already. I have made those things already. You know I've made them and we don't need to make them anymore. It's done and we could put them in the production and get it for me. I wanna make the full application. I wanna make a full app that has everything in it. I wanna make it integrate with Telegram. I wanna make it integrated. I wanna have a Web App side next gues state of the art technology with all the bells and whistles. I want everything even though we only need really need need need to make money to make money and really push. We need two or three things you know it's just so you know it's so I wanna just get like maybe if we can just get some of the emotional I don't know just like really just crack open just really just I wanna see what the full thing I wanna have a full picture of myself right now. I just wanna see myself from the birds iview I wanna see it for I wanna see it. I want to be laid bear raw naked I wanna see everything here. I wanna see it all and then we can do the practical solutions, but I really wanna see everything. I wanna see all the different and I will see how everything connects. How does the dating I wanna see it all cause you hit the nail on the head but I just wanna see it all. I just wanna see it all. I just wanna itch. I wanna scratch the itch. I wanna see it all. It's just it hurts. It fucking hurts and it's makes me feel inferior. Doesn't make me feel good. It makes me feel and I feel like I feel like I should've. I feel like I should've solved this. I feel like I should be done. You know I turned 31 in one month one month from today I'll be 31 and that's so old. no it's not actually old right it's not actually old but it's so old you know and people have kids now people have whole businesses. People are executives peop like people are you know millions and millions of followers and people are all of these things and 10 years younger than me and five years younger than me you know and I'm losing my hair I'm balding I'm balding and I can't. You know some days. It feels like I can't take care of myself. It's you know I had something earlier this month. It's like I lost it like I lost $3000 like and I don't even know where it is. I don't know how I think I just left it on a table and just forgot about it. I don't know if this is and I'm sorry sorry about the non-sex order. It's just like a random thing, but it's like things happen all the time like this you know I can go back and think of these moments where it's like I just you know we have we're on the brink of something crazy and I just like just fuck things up like you I remember you know in 2019 you know I think it's 20 2019 I was a project manager at a decent company and I had a trajectory and yet you know I didn't have enough work and I decided to like not I didn't. I just decided to not learn anything new and just fuck off and you know design clothes at work like why I had I literally just make it like $4000 a month free and clear like doing almost nothing like why would I throw that away? I threw it away. I just threw it away. I just didn't. I just took everything for granted, I threw it and why you know and then you know and then I had some money and then I was making clothes I was drop shipping in the summer and I got some credit cards and I was pushing and I got a loan from Shopify from Shopify and it's like you know I used it but like I didn't fully understand the stuff and I spent all this money and now I've always debt and I can't use credit cards anymore. I destroyed it I destroyed all of my credit and everything and just a year then I went to Russia and I was like OK I'm just gonna move to Russia who cares and even go to Russia dude when I was, I was going to go teach English in Russia and I I like you know literally on the flight like I had a flight. I had that I had everything lined up and I was on the flight and you know I had a layover in Boston and I fucking lost my pass. I put my coat down and I lost my passport like my the one thing I need to just put my coat on the thing and I just forgot it and I just lost it and I couldn't get it back and the police couldn't find it cause there's no cameras in the airport and there's no cameras I guess in the back area of the airport and it's just fine. I don't have a code and I don't have a passport and I had to go back home. I had to ask my friend for money and even after that I have one thing which is I had to save up money. I had to get a new passport three months like a month goes by. I have everything lined up again flight paid for and I and I arrived to the airport late and I miss my international flight. I overslept or I forget the exact thing but I missed it like I miss my international flight. I think I missed it twice and I had to ask one of my friends for help and he helped me and I paid him back but it's like what the fuck and I can't even tell you how many times I've just missed flights. I can't even tell you how many times I miss flights so many times you know and I feel like I just constantly like you know I constantly have these things were just like I don't know like just I don't know. It's like on purpose if it just feels like it's on purpose and it feels like I can't trust myself. It feels like I can't like I feel like I can't trust my brain with basic things and even so even if everything is going well it's like something can just happen. it feels like something can just happen that just you know I was doing well for a while even even without you know OK I'm avoiding all this stuff and I'm you know fear of imperfection but even over the last couple months I was doing OK I was doing fine and then I lost this significant amount of money and now we're like behind on everything you know and it's like for like wow how is it possible? It's like the dumbest thing in the world. I just can't trust my own fucking brain or body with basic things you know it's this and it feels like it's all connected like this like truly internal deep thing inside where it's like if anything starts to go OK then we're just something they're just we're just gonna fucking spike. We're gonna fucking spike the ball in the Enzo and fucking takeoff our clothes and streak around and ruin everything and just and start all over again. you know I don't know what that is. Don't know where it's coming from but that just feels like my life. It feels like every six months every three months we just have a life altering thing just . I just feel like people other people don't have this thing. Why am I do it? Why am I losing this amount of money? Why am I missing these flights? Why am I losing my passports? Why am I like? Why am I having to relearn speaking to women like do you understand the amount of times that I've done this? I feel like I've done even this without AI without AI and without kind of help maybe but it's like I've done this kind of like reset thing like so many times it's not on comment. It's so many times I've learned how to speak to women again and again and again and again I've learned how to work I've learned how to be a basic human being and in a workplace again and again and again and I understand you need to speak to people. I understand you need to hang out with people in the off hours. You need to spend time you need to you need to call them. You need to talk to them even though them even if they don't put in every themselves you have to do that you have to do that to have good relationships in this life and I understand that and I've had to relearn it, redo it again and again I've had to relearn assertiveness. I've had to relearn what it means to be a man what it mea to express yourself to a girl what it means to be genuine and not some Disney genuine, like not some charming like actually express yourself to a person who you like I've learned it so many times even in a genuinely I've just learned it and I feel like why am I re-learning a dude it's like it's like how is it possible? I'm like that you know some broken AI model who's just you know forgets the context of life over and over it's like it's laughable. I'm even laughing a little bit now. How am I forgetting? The context that I'm in on a daily weekly monthly yearly basis and I look bac I have these reflections. I have these blog posts that I've created where it's like I have these things and that I've made that I just you know to know where I'm at in life and I look back and I'm like bro I did this already. This is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. I've did this. I've done this. I've cried over a girl who's not texting back, who who I feel like I w not vulnerable enough with or two vulnerable or not I didn't do enough things. I've done this before I've done this tons of tens of times maybe not hundreds, but tens of times and hundreds if you wanna combine all these different situations kind of into one thing I've done this so many times I've done it so so so so so many times and it's like why how am I relearning over and over it's actually insan like can we and I understand by the way I understand like life is about learning life is about progression but I feel like man how have I not progressed dude I was sitting here in 19 thinking the same thoughts about girls at 19 and I solved it. I thought like a 20 x 26 I was sleeping with a lot of women and even I mean, I had a girlfriend when I was 27 I th like I thought I had some of this man you know and I know and I was able to even in my last official corporate job, dude my level of organization and the level that which I was able to ship project projects was insane. I was able to crush new projects over and over and over and here. I am like with these ideas that I'm still talking about after two months or three months of starting it how is it possible that I was able to just crushed through a new project in a fucking week or a couple days and here I am talking about the same bullshit like after three months it's not possible it's insane. How is it? Yeah so let's go through that. I just I want to see the full picture. I need to see the full picture. Bring it home for me like bring it home for me wrap it all up and show me who I am. I need to see it. I need to see it, I need to see it.",

I don't know what that helps or what it will do, but yeah man it's you hit the nail on the fucking head with all this like it's exact it's exact you got exact thing like it's it's everything it's like yeah who I need to be. It's like well I want to be yeah I wanna be a certain thing in and I and I feel like I can't you know it's with email you you just did it exactly with them. You know it goes across all the things you know with dating I wanna just be a nice boy whatever the fuck that means I just wanna be a nice I just wanna go up to people and say something and be kind of funny and be a nerd and I don't wanna I don't wanna like I don't wanna think of what to do in advance. I don't want to craft the play and I don't want to do any of the stuff and in and the girls don't like me enough. It feels like the girls don't girls don't like me enough for me to just and by the way they have in my life but just now it's just like that yeah they don't like me and they like me by the way girls do like me that's the fucking weird part and all of this things and you understand I'm just gonna I'm probably gonna be repeating myself a little bit but girls do like me you know and I am good at making soft if I'm good at making software I'm good at writing stuff. I'm good at creating things. I know my I know my my clothing is cool people like it. People of know I go to these conferences and people like hundreds of people come up and they want pictures and they want photos and they wanna engage with me and so I know I have external validation of all of the stuff. And even with the music, I've shown people some of the music that I've created. I've shown people and it's AI you know, but people have listened to the music that I've created and they like it. They like it and they see the potential they like it and they're waiting for me to put out more stuff every little video that I put out every little thing I get tons of feedback with people like holy shit you're awesome can do more and yet I stopped. I don't know. I stopped because of that that the feel of that you know I feel like we need more of a strategy. I think I need more of a top level strategy all the way down I need to come up with a rollout plan for everything I need better. You know you got it right with the perfectionism it's like why do you know man that's it's perfect like you described it perfectly. It's like I'm experiencing a pattern of self sabotage where I just avoid doing things because I'm afraid of doing them poorly. It's just fucking a perfect way to say it and I don't know where that came from because I didn't have it the whole time I didn't have it. It's just something that manifested over the last four years or so. It's like it started to come. You know when I started making content in in 2021. I was just making stuff and putting stuff out and when I would talk to girls, I would just go out and I would you know suck or be good and I would get some girls or not and it was just freedom. I was just free you know and I had some depression and I had issues, but I was able to just make stuff and put it out and something happened when you know when I start when I went viral it's like you know and you don't have that full context but it's like I went viral on TikTok, I got like I got 17 million views on one video and then several videos with 1,000,000+ views and you know with these different dancing videos and you know the main context of the first video was me living in my office and I got so much validation from it. I fucking was killing the game. I had these live streams that were that were so big that you know again I mean it's all contextual but for me they were so big. It was so big that even TikTok reached out to me and they gave me a TikTok rep and I had like literally a direct line to talk to. You know to talk about things and to make stuff and they would be include me on these these lives you know these weekly round ups of live streams, and stuf and and I have there's a point where I was getting like 1 million you know 1 million views a week more than 1 million views even impressions a day there was a couple days I got 1,500,000 impression a day on my live stream. It was crazy and you know I think that you know the pattern started around then it's like you know we got to that. I don't know what happened in that at that time you know where it wa you know we had those crazy live stream, but it got to a point you know I wasn't making any money OK and that was one of the big things I wasn't making any money and that started to affect me because like I would do this crazy lifestream and I would have all this you know likes and all the stuff happen and and yeah, I wasn't able to pay for like I wasn't able to buy food. I wasn't able to buy the Uber home and I would have you know supporters that would send me money like even just to get home and do different things but it started to affect me like you know and you can't have these kids. You can't keep that up for forever. You know a lot of times you know they'll be up and down up and down with content, but I didn't have money and and the content started to you know on TikTok, especially men you can have any amount of followers. You can have any amount of thing but if you fall out of the algorithm now you're doing 1000 views for for a video 10,000 views for and man that fucking sucks it fucking sucks and then it fucking sucks even more when you're not making any money and you can't afford to even take a girl out you can't afford to even do the job. You know I had enough money to do the job and I feel like and if I would've kept going back then I would be at a different completely different point in life now, but I didn't you know and it's been up and down I don't know like even with the clothing stuff I don't know yeah I think you got it right I think you got it right it's yeah and you you got the thing it's like yeah I'm not bad at it. I'm not bad at anything. I'm good at things. I'm really good. I think I'm really good. I think there's evidence but I I I can't. I don't wanna put out garbage. I see what's good. I see what's good every day when when I scroll on Instagram and when I scroll on YouTube, I see what good is I see good clothes I see good content I see funny people and it's like I can't. You know I see good good music I even on Spotify I hear good music and it's like a YouTube. I hear good music like I can't you know putting out my shitty my thing and it's not shitty but like the idea like putting out my dumb video or my shitty strong like in the fucking thing it's like I don't know I'm gonna get I don't know. I feel like I'm gonna I'm gonna get 1000 views. I don't know what I don't really the actual thing because it's you're hitting something that's like not totally visible to me. It's not totally visible, but it's like I'm gonna post it and and it's gonna suck. No one's gonna care and and no one should care and it will suck it and I need to build it up and I understand those things. I understand that like you need to post for a while you need that you need to try you need to be trying to do things in new verticals and you need to be pushing and and I understand this and yet you know, I'm not I'm not doing those things and I know I'm hatching some of the stuff but I just I think you're it's really helping me. Try to understand like what the fuck is going on here cause I think I think you'I think you're understanding me a little bit more than I understand myself and I think we're starting to find that that spot I'm not gonna send that message. Thank you for that. Yeah, thank you for that but yeah that's a perfect thing. Yeah it's like yeah I don't wanna. I don't wanna behave a certain way with women like you know yeah instead of finding the middle ground, I just don't do it. You know it's just frustrating so I don't do yeah instead of you know and even with coding with coding like it's it's hard to suck you know coding it's hard to not know you know it's a slow process of learning react or learning you know vite** whatever and you know instead of like taking some time and maybe doing the tutorial once a day or twice a day in addition to all the stuff that I'm doing it's like I'd rather just use a an AI Dev thing you know I'd rather just have one of these LLMs code for me and put push the code instead of like learning some stuff myself like really actually actually learning some of the stuff myself you k you know they'll be some extent of just you know again you know I don't need to know a lot to do this, but like I should be, I want to get to a place where I'm a good developer like I wanna be at.

I've had to relearn what it means to be a man what it mea to express yourself to a girl what it means to be genuine and not some Disney genuine, like not some charming like actually express yourself to a person who you like I've learned it so many times even in a genuinely I've just learned it and I feel like why am I re-learning a dude it's like it's like how is it possible? I'm like that you know some broken AI model who's just you know forgets the context of life over and over it's like it's laughable. I'm even laughing a little bit now. How am I forgetting? The context that I'm in on a daily weekly monthly yearly basis and I look bac I have these reflections. I have these blog posts that I've created where it's like I have these things and that I've made that I just you know to know where I'm at in life and I look back and I'm like bro I did this already. This is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. I've did this. I've done this. I've cried over a girl who's not texting back, who who I feel like I w not vulnerable enough with or two vulnerable or not I didn't do enough things. I've done this before I've done this tons of tens of times maybe not hundreds, but tens of times and hundreds if you wanna combine all these different situations kind of into one thing I've done this so many times I've done it so so so so so many times and it's like why how am I relearning over and over it's actually insan like can we and I understand by the way I understand like life is about learning life is about progression but I feel like man how have I not progressed dude I was sitting here in 19 thinking the same thoughts about girls at 19 and I solved it. I thought like a 20 x 26 I was sleeping with a lot of women and even I mean, I had a girlfriend when I was 27 I th like I thought I had some of this man you know and I know and I was able to even in my last official corporate job, dude my level of organization and the level that which I was able to ship project projects was insane. I was able to crush new projects over and over and over and here. I am like with these ideas that I'm still talking about after two months or three months of starting it how is it possible that I was able to just crushed through a new project in a fucking week or a couple days and here I am talking about the same bullshit like after three months it's not possible it's insane. How is it? Yeah so let's go through that. I just I want to see the full picture. I need to see the full picture. Bring it home for me like bring it home for me wrap it all up and show me who I am. I need to see it. I need to see it, I need to see it."

We can make it immediately usable while keeping the door open for careful expansion later. The key is to make it useful for you first, before even thinking about making it for others.\n\nThe important thing is to use the actual protocol, whether it's in a fancy app or a Google Doc.

We can make it immediately usable while keeping the door open for careful expansion later. The key is to make it useful for you first, before even thinking about making it for others.\n\nThe important thing is to use the actual protocol, whether it's in a fancy app or a Google Doc. The tool is less important than the practice.\n\nShould we focus on getting this MVP working for you first?"

Progress Tracking\n**Priority: Medium**\n- Streak visualization\n- Basic stats dashboard\n- Pattern recognition for triggers\n- Success rate of protocol usage\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Frontend Stack\n- Next.js 13+ with App Router\n- React 18\n- Tailwind CSS\n- shadcn/ui components\n- Supabase Client\n\n### Backend Stack\n- Supabase (Backend as a Service)\n- PostgreSQL (via Supabase)\n- Edge Functions (if needed)\n\n### Database Schema\n\n```sql\n-- Users Table (handled by Supabase Auth)\nauth.users\n  - id\n  - email\n  - created_at\n\n-- User Profiles\nprofiles\n  - id (references auth.users.id)\n  - username\n  - accountability_partner_contact\n  - created_at\n  - updated_at\n\n-- Daily Logs\ndaily_logs\n  - id\n  - user_id (references auth.users.id)\n  - date\n  - small_wins (text[])\n  - mood (integer) -- 1-5\n  - reset_urge (boolean)\n  - used_protocol (boolean)\n  - note (text)\n  - created_at\n  - updated_at\n\n-- Emergency Protocol Logs\nemergency_logs\n  - id\n  - user_id (references auth.users.id)\n  - triggered_at (timestamp)\n  - resolved_at (timestamp)\n  - trigger_notes (text)\n  - resolution_notes (text)\n  - warning_signs (text[])\n  - created_at\n  - updated_at\n\n-- Streaks\nstreaks\n  - id\n  - user_id (references auth.users.id)\n  - start_date\n  - end_date\n  - type (text) -- 'daily_check_in', 'no_reset', etc.\n  - is_active (boolean)\n  - created_at\n  - updated_at\n```\n\n### File Structure\n```\nsrc/\n  app/\n    (auth)/\n      sign-in/page.tsx\n      sign-up/page.tsx\n    (dashboard)/\n      page.tsx\n      daily-log/page.tsx\n      emergency/page.tsx\n      progress/page.tsx\n    layout.tsx\n    page.tsx\n  components/\n    ui/  # shadcn components\n    dashboard/\n      streak-counter.tsx\n      quick-add.tsx\n    emergency/\n      protocol-steps.tsx\n      warning-signs.tsx\n    daily-log/\n      check-in-form.tsx\n    progress/\n      streak-chart.tsx\n    layout/\n      sidebar.tsx\n      header.tsx\n  lib/\n    supabase/\n      client.ts\n    utils/\n      dates.ts\n      streaks.ts\n  types/\n    index.ts\n```\n\n## MVP Phases\n\n### Phase 1 (Critical) - 1-2 days\n- Basic auth setup\n- Dashboard shell\n- Emergency protocol (basic version)\n- Daily log (basic version)\n\n### Phase 2 (Core) - 2-3 days\n- Complete daily log functionality\n- Streak tracking\n- Basic progress views\n- Emergency protocol enhancement\n\n### Phase 3 (Enhancement) - 2-3 days\n- Pattern recognition\n- Data visualization\n- Mobile responsiveness\n- Progressive Web App setup\n\n## Development Guidelines\n\n### General Principles\n1. Ship each feature as it's built\n2. No complex state management initially\n3. Favor simple solutions over optimal ones\n4. Use existing components where possible\n\n### Code Patterns\n- Use React Server Components where possible\n- Client components only when necessary\n- Leverage shadcn/ui components\n- Keep prop drilling minimal\n\n### Testing Strategy\n- Basic component testing\n- Core user flows\n- Database operations\n- Auth flows\n\n## Initial Setup Steps\n\n1. Create Next.js project\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app@latest emergency-protocol --typescript --tailwind --eslint\n```\n\n2. Install core dependencies\n```bash\nnpm install @supabase/supabase-js @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs\nnpm install lucide-react @radix-ui/react-icons\n```\n\n3. Set up shadcn/ui\n```bash\nnpx shadcn-ui@latest init\n```\n\n4. Install required shadcn/ui components\n```bash\nnpx shadcn-ui@latest add button card form input checkbox\nnpx shadcn-ui@latest add progress slider switch tabs toast\n```\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Initialize project with basic structure\n2. Set up Supabase project and auth\n3. Create basic layout with sidebar\n4. Implement auth flow\n5. Build emergency protocol MVP\n6. Add daily log functionality\n7. Integrate streak tracking\n8. Add basic progress views\n\nWould you like to start with any particular phase or component?\n",

So I think from here, it would be best to just go home. And then just come back when I know that it's open. I'm sure somebody will be here in the next, like, you know, I don't know, maybe in the next 4 hours, but I don't know if it's worth it waiting here or if I should just go Home and like Sleep It's it's in the morning. It's 2 in the morning, so I guess, you know, I could sleep. But I did take caffeine and Adderall, so I don't know. Maybe I could stay awake as well. I don't know. What I can do for my phone, I think, what I could do for my phone, I could take stock of all of my projects You know, we've we've started a lot of stuff over the last, like, few weeks stays, and I could really take a second and, like, You know, note all of them Take a note of all of them Put, like, maybe some action items on each of them and like, just see, like, okay. What what does each of these things need? And I can go through my GitHub basically and just, like, say, like, okay. You know, I don't archive I mean, I'll probably archive a bunch of stuff. But, like, I have a lot of stuff that's already existing. It's like, what functionality does each of these things have? What can I use? You know? Can I what pieces can I use of these things that have already been made in order to Actually, you know, we have we have some we have we have work starting tomorrow? So, like, you know, I don't necessarily have the time to necessarily build something else from scratch, but we already have these tools. And, like I mentioned, before, we already have, like, we have, like, 3 or 4 use cases that, like, literally we just need we need a a tool for them So for these, like, 3 use cases, You know, just you do let's, like, isolate them And create a plan to have, like, that one tool created you know, or or just isolate that one tool for you know, for tomorrow, like, so I so whenever I get in the office, I can isolate and create those single tools and then be ready for anything that comes through. As far as those tools, you know, and as far as as far as any of that stuff goes. So we're just absolutely absolutely ready to go. As far as that stuff goes. It does give me some anxiety because, like, again, you know, I wanted something bigger. I wanted something better. But it's, you know, it's been identify you know, I have the I have the thing. Like, we can you know, I have it. So I have it I have it already made so we can just launch it. It can be launched. Put up put up Android and it can be connected with the API and it's all good. So I can isolate those few things. I can go through my projects. See what needs to be done, And, you know, I mean, the scariest thing in the world I mean, this guy I mean, this is probably too big, probably, but you know, the scariest thing is, you know, actually, creating a you know, actually like, having a plan to to post to actually post something on social media You know, I have the music. I have, like, pieces of the music. You know, I could, I could create You know, I have pieces of mute. I have I have kinda finished songs, and then I have, like, other songs that are, like, half done or, like, and then even whenever, you know, I went I just got done with this conference, and I got a few video clips that I was planning on using for you know, for one of the songs that I think I could I think I could cut together, like, I think I could cut together something from from what I have but, you know, fucking so nervous to, like, post it because it's, you know, 5050. You know? On it, you know, 5050 on it. I mean, I love, like, the the song. I got I was so excited about the song, and I was so excited about even the iOS. But nervous to actually post anything. You know? It's like, yeah. Come on. Know. But so I could I could edit I could edit that one video that I I have it, like, kind of ready in the tuck. With the with the song. You know, the song isn't finished kind of, but, like, you know, I could edit it together and have something know, I could edit that. I don't know. So Those are all the things I mean, I guess if I was because I was if I was inside right now, I would I'd probably work on this app plus I'll work on you know, I started a music know, because I was making a music was making a song, and then I really wanted to play it on guitar. And then I was like, I really wanna make my I really wanna make my own version of the you know, chord analysis like a chordify. I think it's called chordify. I wanted to make my own version of the c h r d I f y. It's the name of the app. I wanted to make my own version of it, But and I started it But You know, obviously, know, So that's I would be working on a couple of different apps you know, again, with 35 things. Always, always, always, always. Always a billion things. But I would I guess I would you know, against better judgment, I would probably be working on that even though I should be working on the thing that's actually, like, making money right now. You know? And I I need to make more money. And we have actually a timeline I have actually a deadline you know, to make this other business profitable. So, like, that's the priority. So I don't even think I should be building any of these other apps until you know, we have to be ready to push in this, this main business. So but you know, I don't know. And I have to have a plan. Man, I don't know. There's just too much stuff. But it's like it's so so what I wanna do iOS what I need Do and then there's obviously, like, clothing stuff but I can't I I can't do any I don't think I can do anything because I need to actually finish a tech pack Like, I need to finish some tech packs and send it out, and then then make sure the fabric gets sent to the specific people to make the samples. Because the fabric's ready. Man. Sorry. There's just so much I don't know. I just have too much fucking shit in my head, and I don't know. So much stuff.",

So I think from here, it would be best to just go home. And then just come back when I know that it's open. I'm sure somebody will be here in the next, like, you know, I don't know, maybe in the next 4 hours, but I don't know if it's worth it waiting here or if I should just go Home and like Sleep It's it's in the morning. It's 2 in the morning, so I guess, you know, I could sleep. But I did take caffeine and Adderall, so I don't know. Maybe I could stay awake as well. I don't know. What I can do for my phone, I think, what I could do for my phone, I could take stock of all of my projects You know, we've we've started a lot of stuff over the last, like, few weeks stays, and I could really take a second and, like, You know, note all of them Take a note of all of them Put, like, maybe some action items on each of them and like, just see, like, okay. What what does each of these things need? And I can go through my GitHub basically and just, like, say, like, okay. You know, I don't archive I mean, I'll probably archive a bunch of stuff. But, like, I have a lot of stuff that's already existing. It's like, what functionality does each of these things have? What can I use? You know? Can I what pieces can I use of these things that have already been made in order to Actually, you know, we have we have some we have we have work starting tomorrow? So, like, you know, I don't necessarily have the time to necessarily build something else from scratch, but we already have these tools. And, like I mentioned, before, we already have, like, we have, like, 3 or 4 use cases that, like, literally we just need we need a a tool for them So for these, like, 3 use cases, You know, just you do let's, like, isolate them And create a plan to have, like, that one tool created you know, or or just isolate that one tool for you know, for tomorrow, like, so I so whenever I get in the office, I can isolate and create those single tools and then be ready for anything that comes through. As far as those tools, you know, and as far as as far as any of that stuff goes. So we're just absolutely absolutely ready to go. As far as that stuff goes. It does give me some anxiety because, like, again, you know, I wanted something bigger. I wanted something better. But it's, you know, it's been identify you know, I have the I have the thing. Like, we can you know, I have it. So I have it I have it already made so we can just launch it. It can be launched. Put up put up Android and it can be connected with the API and it's all good. So I can isolate those few things. I can go through my projects. See what needs to be done, And, you know, I mean, the scariest thing in the world I mean, this guy I mean, this is probably too big, probably, but you know, the scariest thing is, you know, actually, creating a you know, actually like, having a plan to to post to actually post something on social media You know, I have the music. I have, like, pieces of the music. You know, I could, I could create You know, I have pieces of mute. I have I have kinda finished songs, and then I have, like, other songs that are, like, half done or, like, and then even whenever, you know, I went I just got done with this conference, and I got a few video clips that I was planning on using for you know, for one of the songs that I think I could I think I could cut together, like, I think I could cut together something from from what I have but, you know, fucking so nervous to, like, post it because it's, you know, 5050. You know? On it, you know, 5050 on it. I mean, I love, like, the the song. I got I was so excited about the song, and I was so excited about even the iOS. But nervous to actually post anything. You know? It's like, yeah. Come on. Know. But so I could I could edit I could edit that one video that I I have it, like, kind of ready in the tuck. With the with the song. You know, the song isn't finished kind of, but, like, you know, I could edit it together and have something know, I could edit that. I don't know. So Those are all the things I mean, I guess if I was because I was if I was inside right now, I would I'd probably work on this app plus I'll work on you know, I started a music know, because I was making a music was making a song, and then I really wanted to play it on guitar. And then I was like, I really wanna make my I really wanna make my own version of the you know, chord analysis like a chordify. I think it's called chordify. I wanted to make my own version of the c h r d I f y. It's the name of the app. I wanted to make my own version of it, But and I started it But You know, obviously, know, So that's I would be working on a couple of different apps you know, again, with 35 things. Always, always, always, always. Always a billion things. But I would I guess I would you know, against better judgment, I would probably be working on that even though I should be working on the thing that's actually, like, making money right now. You know? And I I need to make more money. And we have actually a timeline I have actually a deadline you know, to make this other business profitable. So, like, that's the priority. So I don't even think I should be building any of these other apps until you know, we have to be ready to push in this, this main business. So but you know, I don't know. And I have to have a plan.

			"text": "Yeah. Let's, I'm gonna yeah, let's let's go through the things for tomorrow's tools and and then I have a I even have some more projects that we can go through and kind of, We can go through and kind of add them to the list and then just kind of prioritize them in general. I don't know. Hopefully, I remember all of them in general, but I think I can, but Let's go. As far as the tools needed for tomorrow, the first tool we need and it's already made. We need a it's called, like, a like, a deal parser, if you wanna call it like that. It's a deal parser. Basically, you know, we we have an affiliate network and, you know, whatever that means. It you know, it's a network of basically, we receive, like, these these deals you know, for different countries, for for traffic, for for leads, you know, basically, have, we work with these, media buyers who create traffic who create these leads using Facebook, you know, or or Google or something, And, and there's other media buyers. And basically, other media buyers, they can they can, you know, they say that they run a Google traffic in in Switzerland, and then they generate the Switzerland Claude. Basically, they give a deal and they give a price. Like, if you wanna buy these Switzerland leads, it costs this much and and so on. But all these different so they sell these Claude, and then even other they sell these leads to networks, or, you know, or brands directly. So we see these deals from the media buyers and from these networks. And often, they come in various shapes and forms and sizes. Like, it's all the same information, but format it differently every time. So basically, the tool that's needed is, like, it used to be able to parse the deals you know, and, separate out the information and, do a you know, basically, you know, in in order to be input into the notion have a notion database of all the deals, and we need to be able to upload be able to be able to easily parse and check all the deals that we're getting and then, you know, even change some information if it's wrong or right, whatever. Then you'll be able to upload it into Notion. The other thing that we need to be able to do is, like, we need to be able to easily probably and this is not necessarily and, you know, we could you we could do this from in Notion. As well. But we need the know, we need the option to be be able to update deals I don't know if there's a separate tool or if you just use Notion. Probably Probably, maybe just use Notion. But, know, it's like if somebody sends a new list of deals You know, I guess, If we know, if we upload that new list of deals, know, it should be able to update Notion, you know, with these deals, like, you know, I get and that I guess that one's not correct. So or that one's not, made made yet. I'm gonna say it's not correct. It's not made yet. Like, I guess, know, if if there is a duplicate in notion I guess no. I mean, technically, if there's a duplicate in Notion right now, it just adds, like, plus 1 or something like That I don't know Yeah. I guess we could probably have it replaced or update time or whatever. I know. Probably would be better to, like, update Time. So I gotta so that's I guess it's all still one tool. The second tool that's really needed is the is basically an it's like a it's an invalid Information, Detector I'll pull a Basically, you know, I upload take the know, all the leads that were received for the week, and I put it in a database, and then I have a form thing that I can easily press anytime somebody uploads or asks for, you know, you know, says that that a lead that was received is invalid, can check it or I can or not check it. I can receive the I basically put in the email then it gives me back, like, the phone number, the email, and the first name for her first and last name of the person so that we could send it to our call to So call that lead and make sure that it is invalid. So so we need an invalid checker. That is definitely already made. So invalid checker. Yeah. Invalid checker. And then dealparser. Those are, like, the main two things that would make it make life like you know, a lot easier. I guess, and that's the main thing. And I guess the last tool, like, specific tool that would be just like easy would be like, maybe, like, a prioritized tool where, like, you could just, you know, if if something is marked as priority inside of Notion like it appears There. You know? It's, like, organized. You can you can see it by geo. Again, that might be overkill. Again, But again, we still have Notion that can do everything. But You know, maybe just it's kind of like an interface just to interact with Notion a little bit. Easier and copy stuff a little bit easier possibly. With like just you know, clickable I don't know. Quick to g. You know? I don't know. That might be that might be too much. That might be too. Because that's leaning into, like, my whole platform idea So you know, at least for but I will but as far as, like, if we're talking if we're talking about money, like generating money, again, the thing that we needed to be able to do is sift through the deals very fast and basically cop Like, send a list like, send a copied list of the deals to people. So so probably there you know? And it's probably there's some sort of interface that we could just that I could I could make where it's just like, hey. That's the one thing. It's just be able to interact with the Notion database in a more reasonable way somehow. Whatever that means. And maybe the Notion database, maybe I'm just maybe I'm being lazy as well. It's like, if it's fine the way it is, and we just need to but, again, the thing with Notion is that The thing with Notion is that, like, I don't know. The database is a little bit dirty, and maybe it's just me being lazy, but it's like there's too many fields There's too many things that's happening right now, and it's a little bit dirty. And Maybe and then, to be honest, maybe it's a this is a reflection of Part of the issue is Look, instead of cleaning it's kinda funny how everything kinda comes back to the same, problems or the same, pattern. It's like, basically, instead of, like, cleaning up Notion and cleaning up the columns like, the extra columns that don't need to be there. The dirty columns, it's like I'm making a whole new database, a whole new system for managing stuff. And it's like, all you need to do is just go through motion, kinda clean it up, and, like, work with my coworker just to, like, hey. Let's clean up this thing a little bit. Like, what do we actually need here? Because we have too many fields. We don't need all of these things, and we need to things are breaking because there's too many connections in these formulas. And we don't know we don't, you know, not we don't necessarily know all the stuff that's going into this. And that's Causing Yeah. It can cause things to break, and we don't even know what's broken. I don't even know what's broken. So That's, like, Try to like, you know, whittle this down a lot further to columns that are absolutely necessary. So that's an interesting thing to notice. So because, I mean, all honestly, at the end of the day, like, a lot of stuff can be done from within Notion. We can probably all the a lot of the automations and stuff that's that's being done, it's like all of that, you know, yeah, we can get rid of a lot of that stuff. Get rid of a lot of stuff. Yeah. Like and just have, like, a nice database that kind of that that works. You know? So that's the main those are the tool that's like the idea for that. Job that that whole thing over there. I mean, in the that's the main thing. Of course, there's another thing. We you know, we just had a conference. I probably have you know, we have probably something like 60 60 to 70 or 60 60 to Android 100 100 different contacts that would that I got that we need to know, that we need to message and basically organize. We need to put them in a database, Android we need to, not yeah. I need to put them yeah. I need to basically put them in the database and we need to Kinda have that ready to go and updated for whatever work that we end up doing with them. So we need to, like, identify So we just have it ready. And have the piece of information that we need you know, at ready to ask for like the the fee the fee that we need and then, of course, the integration name that that we wanna do with them. And then probably You know? As an initial thing, as an initial thing, we'll probably just note, like, the GO's that they say you know, and maybe just have that as an ongoing thing on over the just just append it maybe to the note like, hey. They're interested in these ones. This week, this week, this week, you know, and just update update that. As a comment or something. I don't know how to do that. Maybe yeah. We'll just probably do that, it in the actual text of the you know, Notion page that's associated with that person. And then let\u2019s go through some of the main thing with all those so we have to go through like I just kind of categorize those nuts like also but probably for tomorrow obviously to get done and the other side OK so all the projects that I have I mean, I\u2019m just gonna start naming them and I\u2019ll just see if it\u2019s kind of a priority or not. Most of these are not priority. I\u2019ll just go ahead and say we have an air and a lot of these are just me wanting to re-create what other somebody else already created and then just make it kind of better. make it better than what they what they had before basically either make it better than what they had before or basically just get around actually paying for the actual thing cause I have my version and my version is just as good maybe I could even make a couple dollars off of the thing so one of those is a time tracking app there\u2019s similar to rise call RIZE. I don\u2019t know if you know it\u2019s a time to time tracking app for Mac that basically you can track the screen all that stuff so that does that one. I don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019ve done a little bit with it. I did some research. I have like a project file but like I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve actually started it. There is a so that\u2019s like that\u2019s like some level. You know I can give make some money from it so it\u2019s like it\u2019s not like so like no priority cause I do need money and it would be good to have like product some products that are pushed that actually make money actually that actually good but you obviously rise RIZE obviously rise is pretty good already so you know we\u2019re just competing against fire with fire or something like that but but there\u2019s that one there\u2019s a AI language learning app which I started doing I did a lot of research for it. I need to probably read more for the research for that, but we started to make something, but and that once again it\u2019s the same level priority like I guess it\u2019s about money more about money but I think that one\u2019s actually a little bit more interesting to me because you know I need to learn Thai and I wanna learn Thai and I wanna learn Russian and it\u2019s like you know if I could enhance my ability to learn those things then that would be good. I\u2019m basically the app is basically like it\u2019s Pimsleur Pimsleur is that the listening method kind of that\u2019s behind the app that I want to be behind the app like I want to be an audio based learning thing you know where you know it\u2019s kind of a speaking first thing, even though I have read a little bit that speaking first is a little bit dubious as far as it goes like it\u2019s better to experience the language on a regular basis and then you know you can of overtime you can form words, but I don\u2019t know I mean I learned a decent bit of. I learned a good bit of Russian that was a good basis to go through all of that to go through what they had in Pimsleur so but yeah there is there\u2019s a lot. There\u2019s a lot that needs to be done for that one probably one of the more complicated ones but I think I\u2019m a little bit more more interested in that I think I like the time tracking was like pure money probably and this one\u2019s like more interest based so it\u2019s more priority. there\u2019s one project it\u2019s a tech pack tech pack maker tech pack designer that is a I like that I mean I really like that project the deal of it but not but I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m at with it. I don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know what happened with it because I haven\u2019t worked on in a few weeks. I don\u2019t know what stopped with it. I need to check what stop with it, but I know yeah I was it. You know I just wanted the ability to make a tech pack a lot easier or edit one a little bit easier than it is now basically to have a kind of a built-in template or a couple templates that can just be filled in pretty easily with you know it seems that you know so I took all this and I already have like I have like a project like spec out it\u2019s just you\u2019d actually need to actually do it. I need to actually like actually carve it out and finish it so I need to get the carving so that one that you like like you know clothes are one of my interest so it is interesting to do again that one is like that one\u2019s more money based like it\u2019s more like hey this is a problem that I have the probably other people have it so obviously and I see the software that are available and you know there you know they\u2019re good but they cost a lot of money and there\u2019s nothing really for an entry-level person to use and I would be loved to be that option for the entry-level people. You know a good option that has all the whistles and giggles that all that the good stuff has but just for like the normal cheap price of five dollar cheap whatever and whatever I can get away with so is that more you have more money but like I am interested in it so OK. And then there\u2019s the next one is the automatic auto RFP auto RP is like basically responding to you know responding to contracts request whatever responding to government request for work or even private. I guess request for work somebody to be able to like to create the create the outline for it, and then start to fill in the outline based on you know, based on previous answers based on history based on what actually works just to start to create that that\u2019s you know I started to create that and also have a lot of knowledge around that that thing but I don\u2019t know what stopped with it exactly that one again a lot of potential with it and you know if I can make something with it then that\u2019s actually probably a lot higher priority than everything else because if I can make something with it, you know my partner in the states will probably buy me. You know some of you know a better tools to do stuff with so like a new Mac, maybe even GPU\u2019s to run some local models on so it\u2019s possible to you know get some funding if I\u2019m able to and then even reengage in that business possibly you know cause one of the things is like I do need to find a way to reengage that business and generate some revenue because at the moment it is the project management business. Basically, it\u2019s called Way anchor and yeah I just I need a way to reengage with the business and you know this is probably the best way to reengage with the business cause I was getting like probably couple grand a month from it and this was paying my rent in the US stopped a few months ago and you know I was. I\u2019m a little bit struggling now cause I have one source of income. It\u2019s a little bit more dangerous. Life is a little bit more edgy so reinstating that and but reinstating it like because of value is probably super important and but again I mean the other side of it is like if I\u2019m able to generate revenue with any independent app and the independent thing that is a recurring thing then like that\u2019s also good so you know I think revenue and is his priority but also reengage with that business is also priority because obviously the guy is my friend as well. We did go work together and it would be good to kind of reengage that side. then I had I kinda had a big I kinda had a big it\u2019s kind of a big idea that honestly I think other people might be just better than me in many ways but the big idea was kind of a I had this idea for like a project management app on Mac. It was supposed to be like a meta-level project management thing where it will be voice lead so I will certainly you know it\u2019ll be voice lead and basically you know you talk to the AI and be able to you know basically based on your voice it will do actions now this isn\u2019t so super novel like stuff has been made, but I really wanted to connect it to a lot of these existing open source tools that are already super cool that all already work but then you just use your voice just use your voice. You know to actually engage with these things instead of like actually having to type every time you know and you know it you know it\u2019s like annoying to type type type type. It\u2019s like just a you know he can tell to continue continue. I\u2019ll go to the terminal you know to go to the terminal and I\u2019ll start a virtual go to terminal start a virtual you know box for you know Python enter it and install the files and then let\u2019s let\u2019s run the project like we should be able to say that and then start you know I should do the stuff right and that\u2019s that it\u2019s very doable right it\u2019s extremely doable but yeah, we just need to actually connect the stuff and do it now now that is probably you know it\u2019s complicated. The stuff exists, but it\u2019s complicated now that again that one is in the same vein that would help me reengage with white anchor as well, but probably the difficulty of that one is a little bit higher now associated with that I kind of have this like particle, visualization thing AI particle visualization and you know it\u2019s called like FBO particles and it\u2019s like 3JS3JS project that I wanted to use to kind of you know when you\u2019re talking to the AI through for the project management you can see this you know this ball or this like floating thing, you know engaging with you and talking back and when it talks like it can form in a different things and it has these different modes that you know if you make it angry, can you can you? Can you know change if you make it sad it can change if you if you have it doing some work it can change. You don\u2019t want it. I wanted to be like this dynamic experience of you know yeah I wanted to be this really cool thing and I have the 3JS file I have like the basic thing like made and then the last thing that I was doing was connecting Spotify API and then one of the LLM so I started to connect to one of the LLMs one of the API\u2018s to actually get some speech going and then even to get some music going so you can play music to it and have it react to music and obviously you know with the speech, obviously have react to speech so the last thing we\u2019re having some issues connecting up the API\u2018s right you know some hallucinations it was a bit it\u2019s it\u2019s a bit big of context right now for the LLM and so I kinda have to figure out a small chunky way too, and I have to specifically kinda understand how we\u2019re coding this up so that I can make sure that it\u2019s being done right and the files are being in the right in the correct place so is gonna require me to learn a little bit, but I love this project. It\u2019s like one probably my favorite project of all of them, but I would say you know in many ways this one it has like a lot of potential but to me it\u2019s also like other people are just making stuff and I just feel like I can just be eclipse like fuck it over over two seconds just with you know just whatever new thing comes. It\u2019s just like boom done and eclipse and the project is like whatever for fun so I don\u2019t know I mean, but I really like that project. Probably my favorite project is probably spend like a lot of extra time on it but it\u2019s I guess it\u2019s not you know I guess I described I describe the priority so you can kind of assume where it\u2019s supposed to go, but is that then it\u2019s probably like a couple more that I wanna talk about there\u2019s a bourbon app my old friend he\u2019s wanted to make this bourbon community app for basically managing your collection and also price looking up prices, recording prices, locally and keeping track of where bottles are in local shops and in national national stores and everything so it\u2019s kind of like a thing that\u2019s kind of organize all that that\u2019s not you know again we\u2019re working on that together so it\u2019s not really something that I should be doing in my free time personally so I should be leaving that until you know we meet again to participate in, but sometimes you know I just wanna engage in like see what I can do but I probably that\u2019s like probably least priority cause like he supposed to be working on it so it\u2019s not my project supposed to be his project so I should be leaving it so that\u2019s what that is. I mean, but I still wanna play, but it is what it is. This is random one of my other friends he has a he has a Notes app a iMessage based no Notes app where he kinda the idea of the app is kind of to have like you know an almost an iMessage like type of experience with notetaking anyway, that\u2019s the idea behind the app he\u2019s he has like a pro like a one level thing out or together his idea you want you know I was gonna create a PR for it and you know help truck helping like do some features and just helping with this project yeah so I mean that\u2019s not. Yeah that\u2019s not like a priority cause obviously I have my project but I\u2019d like to contribute so it\u2019s probably the least one of the least priorities ones but you know I still like to contribute is my friend and I did tell him might help him so there\u2019s all that and then there is a back to the original thing there\u2019s like the affiliate affiliate project affiliate thing where I was basically my Magnum, opus for this company was gonna be like this this this app that you know where you can manage all the deals like basically notion as the source of truth, but ultimately you know, replace it with like a super base backend you know this is gonna be you know an expo expert and react to expo expo react, native app that would you know basically replace our usage of of notion directly and you\u2019ll be able to interact with it. You know enter new offers. Enter new deals easily all from this app. This is what I was post spending a decent amount of work on, but I was like in between like the particle visualization thing I was talking about it\u2019s like that that one and then this one is like the two things that I was spending the most time on the past week but yeah, like I said like you know, it\u2019s definitely important to have that to get that app out but at the same time like it doesn\u2019t matter if the app is out of the app is cool. The app is beautiful. None of that matters if we don\u2019t make money and so it\u2019s like cool make the app but like bigger things are more important probably it\u2019s actually getting the deals done so especially once once you know, especially once Monday starts probably after like midday Sunday like you know a lot of work to shut down and we need to like actually you know they actually chat with people for like probably a few hours so it\u2019s gonna be a whole thing. The next project, of course there\u2019s the problem that we\u2019re working on together that was like this emergency protocol app really like this probably this is probably the most important app personally just for my life you know so like this probably priority you know obviously have other priorities but different priority. The other idea like it\u2019s kind of go with some of the other stuff. I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s like you know we really need to you know I think you mean you\u2019re helping me out a lot a lot a lot so thank you so much. I wanna say thanks but basically we need to take. I want to take like whatever you know the prompts that basically we\u2019re using in order to have this interaction that we\u2019re having and I wanna be able to take that and put it not of course you put it into you know put it into that app you know and have it as like a system level Prompt And you know whenever you know the person is engaging. You have there if they\u2019re typing in something you know, it would be interesting you know because one of the things that made it really easy for me to engage with this was because it was you know I am speaking into this. I\u2019m speaking into the microphone of my phone of course I\u2019m not speaking to you like I don\u2019t hear your voice, but I\u2019m basically speaking into the microphone of my phone and then I obviously read what comes out now what would make it even easier to engage would be if it was connected obviously to like your voice to voice, and I could just say all the stuff and then I could you know OK this is what we\u2019re gonna do is how we\u2019re gonna try to do it and we can try to we go back-and-forth creating this kind of thing together similar to the way we are now but Even there\u2019s a slightly higher level of engagement cause it\u2019s like I can hear a voice coming back potentially so that would just enhance this a little bit that there\u2019s basically there was a project that I was thinking of I guess it separate but that\u2019s like I wanted to include it but basically there was an AI we were gonna call it a guy facilitator and this was going to be we basically you know, ironically right this is the most ironic thing is like you know you know we have a coaching company that basically we have a coaching company that you know the idea behind it is that people you know yeah people get like group coaching you know it\u2019s called a behavioral therapy type. It\u2019s not like actual therapy right cause it\u2019s not like you know certified people, but if people that are kind of certified in that method and understand the method and engage with the groups on that territory and people get a lot of stuff from it andso the idea was to have kind of an AI level of engagement where you could make a system prompt or whatever and you know and give it tools to be able to engage with people in this level. Now I feel like emergency protocol. I kind of covers that but you know could be separate like a separate thing for for that for that business, but yeah OK. And then the last thing so you can I guess listen you\u2019re seeing like the most degenerate shit this is obviously super degenerate. I\u2019ve literally been walking around probably for 30 minutes telling you about all the projects super degenerate but hey, we can come. We can start to organize something finally and have a have a plan of action so I know I\u2019m judging myself a little bit by calling it degenerate but it feels degenerate to have all this shit literally so like so much stuff that I\u2019m able to talk for fucking 30 minutes about it or you know whatever this amount of time is literally for so long I don\u2019t know like when we started this conversation but so long anyway the last thing was that you know, I was gonna have a kind of my own course platform The idea behind the course platform was going to be you know it\u2019s something where people can you know basically they can engage with the coursework and you know learn something YouTube wise or whatever but then in addition, we basically have kind of boiler plate ready to go for them with any given app so like whatever they\u2019re talking about whatever their idea is, we have the boiler plate already ready you know we have a you know an opinionated boilerplate that they can press a button clone and basically start working on so the idea would be to go through the coursework in general cause you need some sort level of basis of understanding of computer computers, and just stuff in general in order to like engage with the stuff but basically from there you know you could press a button you know and then and then in general, you should be able to deploy it like we have a platform there it\u2019s called platforms. Verel has this platforms template thing, and basically I could use that like so the people can engage with the stuff you know clone the thing and ultimately deploy it to their own kind of peace. You know their own what do you wanna call their own URL their own domain that\u2019s like on my main domain right so it\u2019s like kinda cool. You know that they get to number one get the boiler plate to get access to probably whatever AI situation the project management situation that I have the voice space thing that whatever able to make that that can do and you know we\u2019re able to have our own kind of version of Claude artifacts or lovable whatever you want it\u2019s lovable both BOLT. NEW both that new or 8 o\u2019clock artifacts we\u2019re able to have our own version of one of one of those things that can be able to generate code or were able to connect, you know connect you know connect the web app to directly to the code via the multi the model the model context protocol that\u2019s from from anthropic you know they can enter their information and obviously they were able to connect to the different things and able to get stuff done, but you know the ideas I kind of like you have my own course platform that you know that people can engage with their you know maybe even talk with each other you know collaborate there\u2019s even the idea of like maybe like people can team up cause some way you know it\u2019s like hey there\u2019s like three people like hey all of you like this is you know you learn how to you know you have to get a project like each of you has a responsibility like Meka branch make that one feature and merge it you know and then merge it but you know then somebody else has tested you know you can learn how to be a soft engineer and that in that way where you can emerge these poor request and test them and do all that shit. I don\u2019t even know how to do all that stuff but that\u2019s like the idea behind that platform. But I think that\u2019s all of the projects you know there was a general one where it\u2019s like you know a you know if we\u2019re able to there\u2019s a general one and I guess it goes along with the platforms one where it\u2019s like hey if I\u2019m able to communicate that I can build stuff you know build up prototypes and push it for people kind of us as a full-time kind of coder you know you know AI code or we can iterate on stuff and make stuff for people like theoretically charge a lot of money for that and there\u2019s a girl that\u2019s doing it. I just watched an interview with her. You know for all these things you know you have to take it with a grain of salt, but you know the charge six figures for some of the stuff that\u2019s crazy money to make to make something they\u2019re charging six figures like why would somebody go with them instead of going with a an actual like agency that of engineers for the life of me I have no idea, but they people do I guess and that\u2019s interesting to me you know and there\u2019s no reason why that lady can do it and I can\u2019t do it right and that\u2019s gonna have a different thing altogether we did it. We did it by domain back in the day, called process, joy process joy, and that was gonna be the name of the strategic kind of thing that we were gonna be using the consult with people originally we were gonna be using like make.com and what\u2019s the other one is happier we were gonna be using those two things to help people automate stuff and create processes but ultimately like you know find customers I don\u2019t know you have to find customers and you have to offer them stuff and then you have to push and I never did any of that. I just had the knowledge, but I never actually found any customers which again you know it\u2019s kind of the no we have the potential I always had to have the insane potential of all that knowledge and even now it\u2019s like all that knowledge I\u2019ve all the knowledge and theoretically I could help a lot of customers a lot of people a lot of businesses and we\u2019re sitting on you know looks like we\u2019re sitting on a fucking gold mine but nothing\u2018s happening at all actually nothing\u2019s happening with the fucking gold so I mean that\u2019s a big priority. I guess that I mean, cause that goes along with way anchor, and you can kind of connect up with some of the other projects that I\u2019ve already talked about with anchor so like that is the kind of Meta idea for that you know, you obviously create our own little apps that people can use, but then is also the piece of like hey you see how we solve our own problems you say we\u2019re solving problems in the project management and construction industry. We can easily solve problems in your industry you know because we have these tools and we fucking really good at it and we can do anything in like a week or two days or whatever OK so now you have like basically the context on my fucking entire life. Hopefully, you can kind of figure out how to parse it.",

					"type": "text",
					"text": "Yeah. Let's, I'm gonna yeah, let's let's go through the things for tomorrow's tools and and then I have a I even have some more projects that we can go through and kind of, We can go through and kind of add them to the list and then just kind of prioritize them in general. I don't know. Hopefully, I remember all of them in general, but I think I can, but Let's go. As far as the tools needed for tomorrow, the first tool we need and it's already made. We need a it's called, like, a like, a deal parser, if you wanna call it like that. It's a deal parser. Basically, you know, we we have an affiliate network and, you know, whatever that means. It you know, it's a network of basically, we receive, like, these these deals you know, for different countries, for for traffic, for for leads, you know, basically, have, we work with these, media buyers who create traffic who create these leads using Facebook, you know, or or Google or something, And, and there's other media buyers. And basically, other media buyers, they can they can, you know, they say that they run a Google traffic in in Switzerland, and then they generate the Switzerland Claude. Basically, they give a deal and they give a price. Like, if you wanna buy these Switzerland leads, it costs this much and and so on. But all these different so they sell these Claude, and then even other they sell these leads to networks, or, you know, or brands directly. So we see these deals from the media buyers and from these networks. And often, they come in various shapes and forms and sizes. Like, it's all the same information, but format it differently every time. So basically, the tool that's needed is, like, it used to be able to parse the deals you know, and, separate out the information and, do a you know, basically, you know, in in order to be input into the notion have a notion database of all the deals, and we need to be able to upload be able to be able to easily parse and check all the deals that we're getting and then, you know, even change some information if it's wrong or right, whatever. Then you'll be able to upload it into Notion. The other thing that we need to be able to do is, like, we need to be able to easily probably and this is not necessarily and, you know, we could you we could do this from in Notion. As well. But we need the know, we need the option to be be able to update deals I don't know if there's a separate tool or if you just use Notion. Probably Probably, maybe just use Notion. But, know, it's like if somebody sends a new list of deals You know, I guess, If we know, if we upload that new list of deals, know, it should be able to update Notion, you know, with these deals, like, you know, I get and that I guess that one's not correct. So or that one's not, made made yet. I'm gonna say it's not correct. It's not made yet. Like, I guess, know, if if there is a duplicate in notion I guess no. I mean, technically, if there's a duplicate in Notion right now, it just adds, like, plus 1 or something like That I don't know Yeah. I guess we could probably have it replaced or update time or whatever. I know. Probably would be better to, like, update Time. So I gotta so that's I guess it's all still one tool. The second tool that's really needed is the is basically an it's like a it's an invalid Information, Detector I'll pull a Basically, you know, I upload take the know, all the leads that were received for the week, and I put it in a database, and then I have a form thing that I can easily press anytime somebody uploads or asks for, you know, you know, says that that a lead that was received is invalid, can check it or I can or not check it. I can receive the I basically put in the email then it gives me back, like, the phone number, the email, and the first name for her first and last name of the person so that we could send it to our call to So call that lead and make sure that it is invalid. So so we need an invalid checker. That is definitely already made. So invalid checker. Yeah. Invalid checker. And then dealparser. Those are, like, the main two things that would make it make life like you know, a lot easier. I guess, and that's the main thing. And I guess the last tool, like, specific tool that would be just like easy would be like, maybe, like, a prioritized tool where, like, you could just, you know, if if something is marked as priority inside of Notion like it appears There. You know? It's, like, organized. You can you can see it by geo. Again, that might be overkill. Again, But again, we still have Notion that can do everything. But You know, maybe just it's kind of like an interface just to interact with Notion a little bit. Easier and copy stuff a little bit easier possibly. With like just you know, clickable I don't know. Quick to g. You know? I don't know. That might be that might be too much. That might be too. Because that's leaning into, like, my whole platform idea So you know, at least for but I will but as far as, like, if we're talking if we're talking about money, like generating money, again, the thing that we needed to be able to do is sift through the deals very fast and basically cop Like, send a list like, send a copied list of the deals to people. So so probably there you know? And it's probably there's some sort of interface that we could just that I could I could make where it's just like, hey. That's the one thing. It's just be able to interact with the Notion database in a more reasonable way somehow. Whatever that means. And maybe the Notion database, maybe I'm just maybe I'm being lazy as well. It's like, if it's fine the way it is, and we just need to but, again, the thing with Notion is that The thing with Notion is that, like, I don't know. The database is a little bit dirty, and maybe it's just me being lazy, but it's like there's too many fields There's too many things that's happening right now, and it's a little bit dirty. And Maybe and then, to be honest, maybe it's a this is a reflection of Part of the issue is Look, instead of cleaning it's kinda funny how everything kinda comes back to the same, problems or the same, pattern. It's like, basically, instead of, like, cleaning up Notion and cleaning up the columns like, the extra columns that don't need to be there. The dirty columns, it's like I'm making a whole new database, a whole new system for managing stuff. And it's like, all you need to do is just go through motion, kinda clean it up, and, like, work with my coworker just to, like, hey. Let's clean up this thing a little bit. Like, what do we actually need here? Because we have too many fields. We don't need all of these things, and we need to things are breaking because there's too many connections in these formulas. And we don't know we don't, you know, not we don't necessarily know all the stuff that's going into this. And that's Causing Yeah. It can cause things to break, and we don't even know what's broken. I don't even know what's broken. So That's, like, Try to like, you know, whittle this down a lot further to columns that are absolutely necessary. So that's an interesting thing to notice. So because, I mean, all honestly, at the end of the day, like, a lot of stuff can be done from within Notion. We can probably all the a lot of the automations and stuff that's that's being done, it's like all of that, you know, yeah, we can get rid of a lot of that stuff. Get rid of a lot of stuff. Yeah. Like and just have, like, a nice database that kind of that that works. You know? So that's the main those are the tool that's like the idea for that. Job that that whole thing over there. I mean, in the that's the main thing. Of course, there's another thing. We you know, we just had a conference. I probably have you know, we have probably something like 60 60 to 70 or 60 60 to Android 100 100 different contacts that would that I got that we need to know, that we need to message and basically organize. We need to put them in a database, Android we need to, not yeah. I need to put them yeah. I need to basically put them in the database and we need to Kinda have that ready to go and updated for whatever work that we end up doing with them. So we need to, like, identify So we just have it ready. And have the piece of information that we need you know, at ready to ask for like the the fee the fee that we need and then, of course, the integration name that that we wanna do with them. And then probably You know? As an initial thing, as an initial thing, we'll probably just note, like, the GO's that they say you know, and maybe just have that as an ongoing thing on over the just just append it maybe to the note like, hey. They're interested in these ones. This week, this week, this week, you know, and just update update that. As a comment or something. I don't know how to do that. Maybe yeah. We'll just probably do that, it in the actual text of the you know, Notion page that's associated with that person. And then let\u2019s go through some of the main thing with all those so we have to go through like I just kind of categorize those nuts like also but probably for tomorrow obviously to get done and the other side OK so all the projects that I have I mean, I\u2019m just gonna start naming them and I\u2019ll just see if it\u2019s kind of a priority or not. Most of these are not priority. I\u2019ll just go ahead and say we have an air and a lot of these are just me wanting to re-create what other somebody else already created and then just make it kind of better. make it better than what they what they had before basically either make it better than what they had before or basically just get around actually paying for the actual thing cause I have my version and my version is just as good maybe I could even make a couple dollars off of the thing so one of those is a time tracking app there\u2019s similar to rise call RIZE. I don\u2019t know if you know it\u2019s a time to time tracking app for Mac that basically you can track the screen all that stuff so that does that one. I don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019ve done a little bit with it. I did some research. I have like a project file but like I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve actually started it. There is a so that\u2019s like that\u2019s like some level. You know I can give make some money from it so it\u2019s like it\u2019s not like so like no priority cause I do need money and it would be good to have like product some products that are pushed that actually make money actually that actually good but you obviously rise RIZE obviously rise is pretty good already so you know we\u2019re just competing against fire with fire or something like that but but there\u2019s that one there\u2019s a AI language learning app which I started doing I did a lot of research for it. I need to probably read more for the research for that, but we started to make something, but and that once again it\u2019s the same level priority like I guess it\u2019s about money more about money but I think that one\u2019s actually a little bit more interesting to me because you know I need to learn Thai and I wanna learn Thai and I wanna learn Russian and it\u2019s like you know if I could enhance my ability to learn those things then that would be good. I\u2019m basically the app is basically like it\u2019s Pimsleur Pimsleur is that the listening method kind of that\u2019s behind the app that I want to be behind the app like I want to be an audio based learning thing you know where you know it\u2019s kind of a speaking first thing, even though I have read a little bit that speaking first is a little bit dubious as far as it goes like it\u2019s better to experience the language on a regular basis and then you know you can of overtime you can form words, but I don\u2019t know I mean I learned a decent bit of. I learned a good bit of Russian that was a good basis to go through all of that to go through what they had in Pimsleur so but yeah there is there\u2019s a lot. There\u2019s a lot that needs to be done for that one probably one of the more complicated ones but I think I\u2019m a little bit more more interested in that I think I like the time tracking was like pure money probably and this one\u2019s like more interest based so it\u2019s more priority. there\u2019s one project it\u2019s a tech pack tech pack maker tech pack designer that is a I like that I mean I really like that project the deal of it but not but I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m at with it. I don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know what happened with it because I haven\u2019t worked on in a few weeks. I don\u2019t know what stopped with it. I need to check what stop with it, but I know yeah I was it. You know I just wanted the ability to make a tech pack a lot easier or edit one a little bit easier than it is now basically to have a kind of a built-in template or a couple templates that can just be filled in pretty easily with you know it seems that you know so I took all this and I already have like I have like a project like spec out it\u2019s just you\u2019d actually need to actually do it. I need to actually like actually carve it out and finish it so I need to get the carving so that one that you like like you know clothes are one of my interest so it is interesting to do again that one is like that one\u2019s more money based like it\u2019s more like hey this is a problem that I have the probably other people have it so obviously and I see the software that are available and you know there you know they\u2019re good but they cost a lot of money and there\u2019s nothing really for an entry-level person to use and I would be loved to be that option for the entry-level people. You know a good option that has all the whistles and giggles that all that the good stuff has but just for like the normal cheap price of five dollar cheap whatever and whatever I can get away with so is that more you have more money but like I am interested in it so OK. And then there\u2019s the next one is the automatic auto RFP auto RP is like basically responding to you know responding to contracts request whatever responding to government request for work or even private. I guess request for work somebody to be able to like to create the create the outline for it, and then start to fill in the outline based on you know, based on previous answers based on history based on what actually works just to start to create that that\u2019s you know I started to create that and also have a lot of knowledge around that that thing but I don\u2019t know what stopped with it exactly that one again a lot of potential with it and you know if I can make something with it then that\u2019s actually probably a lot higher priority than everything else because if I can make something with it, you know my partner in the states will probably buy me. You know some of you know a better tools to do stuff with so like a new Mac, maybe even GPU\u2019s to run some local models on so it\u2019s possible to you know get some funding if I\u2019m able to and then even reengage in that business possibly you know cause one of the things is like I do need to find a way to reengage that business and generate some revenue because at the moment it is the project management business. Basically, it\u2019s called Way anchor and yeah I just I need a way to reengage with the business and you know this is probably the best way to reengage with the business cause I was getting like probably couple grand a month from it and this was paying my rent in the US stopped a few months ago and you know I was. I\u2019m a little bit struggling now cause I have one source of income. It\u2019s a little bit more dangerous. Life is a little bit more edgy so reinstating that and but reinstating it like because of value is probably super important and but again I mean the other side of it is like if I\u2019m able to generate revenue with any independent app and the independent thing that is a recurring thing then like that\u2019s also good so you know I think revenue and is his priority but also reengage with that business is also priority because obviously the guy is my friend as well. We did go work together and it would be good to kind of reengage that side. then I had I kinda had a big I kinda had a big it\u2019s kind of a big idea that honestly I think other people might be just better than me in many ways but the big idea was kind of a I had this idea for like a project management app on Mac. It was supposed to be like a meta-level project management thing where it will be voice lead so I will certainly you know it\u2019ll be voice lead and basically you know you talk to the AI and be able to you know basically based on your voice it will do actions now this isn\u2019t so super novel like stuff has been made, but I really wanted to connect it to a lot of these existing open source tools that are already super cool that all already work but then you just use your voice just use your voice. You know to actually engage with these things instead of like actually having to type every time you know and you know it you know it\u2019s like annoying to type type type type. It\u2019s like just a you know he can tell to continue continue. I\u2019ll go to the terminal you know to go to the terminal and I\u2019ll start a virtual go to terminal start a virtual you know box for you know Python enter it and install the files and then let\u2019s let\u2019s run the project like we should be able to say that and then start you know I should do the stuff right and that\u2019s that it\u2019s very doable right it\u2019s extremely doable but yeah, we just need to actually connect the stuff and do it now now that is probably you know it\u2019s complicated. The stuff exists, but it\u2019s complicated now that again that one is in the same vein that would help me reengage with white anchor as well, but probably the difficulty of that one is a little bit higher now associated with that I kind of have this like particle, visualization thing AI particle visualization and you know it\u2019s called like FBO particles and it\u2019s like 3JS3JS project that I wanted to use to kind of you know when you\u2019re talking to the AI through for the project management you can see this you know this ball or this like floating thing, you know engaging with you and talking back and when it talks like it can form in a different things and it has these different modes that you know if you make it angry, can you can you? Can you know change if you make it sad it can change if you if you have it doing some work it can change. You don\u2019t want it. I wanted to be like this dynamic experience of you know yeah I wanted to be this really cool thing and I have the 3JS file I have like the basic thing like made and then the last thing that I was doing was connecting Spotify API and then one of the LLM so I started to connect to one of the LLMs one of the API\u2018s to actually get some speech going and then even to get some music going so you can play music to it and have it react to music and obviously you know with the speech, obviously have react to speech so the last thing we\u2019re having some issues connecting up the API\u2018s right you know some hallucinations it was a bit it\u2019s it\u2019s a bit big of context right now for the LLM and so I kinda have to figure out a small chunky way too, and I have to specifically kinda understand how we\u2019re coding this up so that I can make sure that it\u2019s being done right and the files are being in the right in the correct place so is gonna require me to learn a little bit, but I love this project. It\u2019s like one probably my favorite project of all of them, but I would say you know in many ways this one it has like a lot of potential but to me it\u2019s also like other people are just making stuff and I just feel like I can just be eclipse like fuck it over over two seconds just with you know just whatever new thing comes. It\u2019s just like boom done and eclipse and the project is like whatever for fun so I don\u2019t know I mean, but I really like that project. Probably my favorite project is probably spend like a lot of extra time on it but it\u2019s I guess it\u2019s not you know I guess I described I describe the priority so you can kind of assume where it\u2019s supposed to go, but is that then it\u2019s probably like a couple more that I wanna talk about there\u2019s a bourbon app my old friend he\u2019s wanted to make this bourbon community app for basically managing your collection and also price looking up prices, recording prices, locally and keeping track of where bottles are in local shops and in national national stores and everything so it\u2019s kind of like a thing that\u2019s kind of organize all that that\u2019s not you know again we\u2019re working on that together so it\u2019s not really something that I should be doing in my free time personally so I should be leaving that until you know we meet again to participate in, but sometimes you know I just wanna engage in like see what I can do but I probably that\u2019s like probably least priority cause like he supposed to be working on it so it\u2019s not my project supposed to be his project so I should be leaving it so that\u2019s what that is. I mean, but I still wanna play, but it is what it is. This is random one of my other friends he has a he has a Notes app a iMessage based no Notes app where he kinda the idea of the app is kind of to have like you know an almost an iMessage like type of experience with notetaking anyway, that\u2019s the idea behind the app he\u2019s he has like a pro like a one level thing out or together his idea you want you know I was gonna create a PR for it and you know help truck helping like do some features and just helping with this project yeah so I mean that\u2019s not. Yeah that\u2019s not like a priority cause obviously I have my project but I\u2019d like to contribute so it\u2019s probably the least one of the least priorities ones but you know I still like to contribute is my friend and I did tell him might help him so there\u2019s all that and then there is a back to the original thing there\u2019s like the affiliate affiliate project affiliate thing where I was basically my Magnum, opus for this company was gonna be like this this this app that you know where you can manage all the deals like basically notion as the source of truth, but ultimately you know, replace it with like a super base backend you know this is gonna be you know an expo expert and react to expo expo react, native app that would you know basically replace our usage of of notion directly and you\u2019ll be able to interact with it. You know enter new offers. Enter new deals easily all from this app. This is what I was post spending a decent amount of work on, but I was like in between like the particle visualization thing I was talking about it\u2019s like that that one and then this one is like the two things that I was spending the most time on the past week but yeah, like I said like you know, it\u2019s definitely important to have that to get that app out but at the same time like it doesn\u2019t matter if the app is out of the app is cool. The app is beautiful. None of that matters if we don\u2019t make money and so it\u2019s like cool make the app but like bigger things are more important probably it\u2019s actually getting the deals done so especially once once you know, especially once Monday starts probably after like midday Sunday like you know a lot of work to shut down and we need to like actually you know they actually chat with people for like probably a few hours so it\u2019s gonna be a whole thing. The next project, of course there\u2019s the problem that we\u2019re working on together that was like this emergency protocol app really like this probably this is probably the most important app personally just for my life you know so like this probably priority you know obviously have other priorities but different priority. The other idea like it\u2019s kind of go with some of the other stuff. I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s like you know we really need to you know I think you mean you\u2019re helping me out a lot a lot a lot so thank you so much. I wanna say thanks but basically we need to take. I want to take like whatever you know the prompts that basically we\u2019re using in order to have this interaction that we\u2019re having and I wanna be able to take that and put it not of course you put it into you know put it into that app you know and have it as like a system level Prompt And you know whenever you know the person is engaging. You have there if they\u2019re typing in something you know, it would be interesting you know because one of the things that made it really easy for me to engage with this was because it was you know I am speaking into this. I\u2019m speaking into the microphone of my phone of course I\u2019m not speaking to you like I don\u2019t hear your voice, but I\u2019m basically speaking into the microphone of my phone and then I obviously read what comes out now what would make it even easier to engage would be if it was connected obviously to like your voice to voice, and I could just say all the stuff and then I could you know OK this is what we\u2019re gonna do is how we\u2019re gonna try to do it and we can try to we go back-and-forth creating this kind of thing together similar to the way we are now but Even there\u2019s a slightly higher level of engagement cause it\u2019s like I can hear a voice coming back potentially so that would just enhance this a little bit that there\u2019s basically there was a project that I was thinking of I guess it separate but that\u2019s like I wanted to include it but basically there was an AI we were gonna call it a guy facilitator and this was going to be we basically you know, ironically right this is the most ironic thing is like you know you know we have a coaching company that basically we have a coaching company that you know the idea behind it is that people you know yeah people get like group coaching you know it\u2019s called a behavioral therapy type. It\u2019s not like actual therapy right cause it\u2019s not like you know certified people, but if people that are kind of certified in that method and understand the method and engage with the groups on that territory and people get a lot of stuff from it andso the idea was to have kind of an AI level of engagement where you could make a system prompt or whatever and you know and give it tools to be able to engage with people in this level. Now I feel like emergency protocol. I kind of covers that but you know could be separate like a separate thing for for that for that business, but yeah OK. And then the last thing so you can I guess listen you\u2019re seeing like the most degenerate shit this is obviously super degenerate. I\u2019ve literally been walking around probably for 30 minutes telling you about all the projects super degenerate but hey, we can come. We can start to organize something finally and have a have a plan of action so I know I\u2019m judging myself a little bit by calling it degenerate but it feels degenerate to have all this shit literally so like so much stuff that I\u2019m able to talk for fucking 30 minutes about it or you know whatever this amount of time is literally for so long I don\u2019t know like when we started this conversation but so long anyway the last thing was that you know, I was gonna have a kind of my own course platform The idea behind the course platform was going to be you know it\u2019s something where people can you know basically they can engage with the coursework and you know learn something YouTube wise or whatever but then in addition, we basically have kind of boiler plate ready to go for them with any given app so like whatever they\u2019re talking about whatever their idea is, we have the boiler plate already ready you know we have a you know an opinionated boilerplate that they can press a button clone and basically start working on so the idea would be to go through the coursework in general cause you need some sort level of basis of understanding of computer computers, and just stuff in general in order to like engage with the stuff but basically from there you know you could press a button you know and then and then in general, you should be able to deploy it like we have a platform there it\u2019s called platforms. Verel has this platforms template thing, and basically I could use that like so the people can engage with the stuff you know clone the thing and ultimately deploy it to their own kind of peace. You know their own what do you wanna call their own URL their own domain that\u2019s like on my main domain right so it\u2019s like kinda cool. You know that they get to number one get the boiler plate to get access to probably whatever AI situation the project management situation that I have the voice space thing that whatever able to make that that can do and you know we\u2019re able to have our own kind of version of Claude artifacts or lovable whatever you want it\u2019s lovable both BOLT. NEW both that new or 8 o\u2019clock artifacts we\u2019re able to have our own version of one of one of those things that can be able to generate code or were able to connect, you know connect you know connect the web app to directly to the code via the multi the model the model context protocol that\u2019s from from anthropic you know they can enter their information and obviously they were able to connect to the different things and able to get stuff done, but you know the ideas I kind of like you have my own course platform that you know that people can engage with their you know maybe even talk with each other you know collaborate there\u2019s even the idea of like maybe like people can team up cause some way you know it\u2019s like hey there\u2019s like three people like hey all of you like this is you know you learn how to you know you have to get a project like each of you has a responsibility like Meka branch make that one feature and merge it you know and then merge it but you know then somebody else has tested you know you can learn how to be a soft engineer and that in that way where you can emerge these poor request and test them and do all that shit. I don\u2019t even know how to do all that stuff but that\u2019s like the idea behind that platform. But I think that\u2019s all of the projects you know there was a general one where it\u2019s like you know a you know if we\u2019re able to there\u2019s a general one and I guess it goes along with the platforms one where it\u2019s like hey if I\u2019m able to communicate that I can build stuff you know build up prototypes and push it for people kind of us as a full-time kind of coder you know you know AI code or we can iterate on stuff and make stuff for people like theoretically charge a lot of money for that and there\u2019s a girl that\u2019s doing it. I just watched an interview with her. You know for all these things you know you have to take it with a grain of salt, but you know the charge six figures for some of the stuff that\u2019s crazy money to make to make something they\u2019re charging six figures like why would somebody go with them instead of going with a an actual like agency that of engineers for the life of me I have no idea, but they people do I guess and that\u2019s interesting to me you know and there\u2019s no reason why that lady can do it and I can\u2019t do it right and that\u2019s gonna have a different thing altogether we did it. We did it by domain back in the day, called process, joy process joy, and that was gonna be the name of the strategic kind of thing that we were gonna be using the consult with people originally we were gonna be using like make.com and what\u2019s the other one is happier we were gonna be using those two things to help people automate stuff and create processes but ultimately like you know find customers I don\u2019t know you have to find customers and you have to offer them stuff and then you have to push and I never did any of that. I just had the knowledge, but I never actually found any customers which again you know it\u2019s kind of the no we have the potential I always had to have the insane potential of all that knowledge and even now it\u2019s like all that knowledge I\u2019ve all the knowledge and theoretically I could help a lot of customers a lot of people a lot of businesses and we\u2019re sitting on you know looks like we\u2019re sitting on a fucking gold mine but nothing\u2018s happening at all actually nothing\u2019s happening with the fucking gold so I mean that\u2019s a big priority. I guess that I mean, cause that goes along with way anchor, and you can kind of connect up with some of the other projects that I\u2019ve already talked about with anchor so like that is the kind of Meta idea for that you know, you obviously create our own little apps that people can use, but then is also the piece of like hey you see how we solve our own problems you say we\u2019re solving problems in the project management and construction industry. We can easily solve problems in your industry you know because we have these tools and we fucking really good at it and we can do anything in like a week or two days or whatever OK so now you have like basically the context on my fucking entire life. Hopefully, you can kind of figure out how to parse it."

Try to get out of it. Number 1, every day, I'm gonna have to I have to, do revenue stuff. Like, core there's gonna be core tasks. So basically, every day, you know, we're gonna have probably anywhere from 4 to 8 Maybe not 8 hours, but I let's I'd like to blow on the low end. If we're actually doing what we need to be doing, and let's say, like, we're if we, like, are excellent at everything, if we're excellent at life, we have 4 hours of negotiating and talking with people. In reality, I think for the next little while, it's probably gonna be closer to it might even be, like, 8. It might even be 8 hours of just kind of going back and forth with people on new deals and kinda keeping the pressure up on stuff. Obviously, that leaves limited engagement for with other things. But, like, you know, I I'm up. I mean, I'm awake, like, know, 6 let's say, what, You know, it's 24 hours in a day. I'm awake, like, between 16 and 18 hours of the day. Like, We can you know? So we have time. We have at least 8 hours to do something else, maybe 8 10 hours to do something else. So look, we can use that time. Then the other thing. Okay. Let's say let's say we really push towards this schedule regardless, like, let's say we push towards it, and we'd say, like, okay, Monday, we work on way anchor stuff. Let's say if I get free time, if I get downtime, which is an if, we're prioritizing revenue, I guess. It's well, not I guess. I mean, probably again, it's, like, what we need to do Let's say if we do that, you know, let's prioritize weigh anchor on Monday. We Did you Tuesday's creative day. We can, like, have a good time, like, create music, like, make some content, in in a extra time Wednesday is like, hey. We get to, like, one of the whatever project we're working on, we get to, like, alright. That's the day we get to, like, absolute absolutely Push on it I wonder like, Wednesday and, you know, we see revenue focus. Mirror Monday structure. Oh, I see. I see. Okay. So Thursday is more like Monday where we're, like, Yeah. Maybe we could just able to break it down a little a little bit more, I guess. It's just with the new ideas of, like, I have to do I'm gonna have to chat with people every single day Also, on the 14th or 15th, right now, it's the 8th It's the 8th right now. On 14th 15th, I wanna go out with this girl. Can you imagine? We were just, I was just trying to you about, we were just going back and forth about, like, the relationship stuff. And and this girl, man, I'm so excited. A little you know, I I'm excited. And I need to tell somebody, I guess. I'm excited. She she, she said that she's, she's she'll stay in Bangkok for one more day. Yeah. I got me smiling. Got me smiling ear to ear. You know? It's Smiling ear to ear. She says she's staying in Bangkok one day, maybe 2 days. She's thinking about it, and I could see that she's she smiles. She's like a a she's a beautiful girl. She smiles when she sees me, and You know, I mean, one of this it She wasn't to be honest, she wasn't the girl that triggered this wasn't the girl that I was waiting on a text on, but She's a girl that you know, I did write a song about the other day, and she is a girl that's, like, con was contributing to this to the triggering of this you know, from the girl you know, that earlier. She's, like, one that contributed in general And you know, I guess in the end, it's like I was able to, like, really be myself around her and You know, in a way that I like, I really hate. Like, I was you know, I was really open with her about everything in life and, I was really open with her and about being nervous about not knowing what to do with her, about not knowing what to say, and not knowing how to engage and, and maybe at the very end, I I didn't feel, like, totally comfortable because she was, like, I don't know. I mean, the situation, she had all the control. Right. It was like, felt kind of powerless in many ways, like, you know, it's at the very end of the day, if you wanna call it a date.

			"text": "Hey. Had a little bit of a hiccup to it's 6 o'clock AM. Last time I chatted, I think I sent a message at, like, 2. So I had a little bit of a issue with, a taxi. You know, I, meant to call it sooner, But I didn't and then I ended up stranded for a few hours So I had to, like, walk to the 711 You know? I had to buy a charger. Then you know, I had to ask them for a charger 2 in order to pay, I actually realized that I did have I had my cards, so I could have just paid. But so I didn't have to actually ask them. But still did. You know, it took me a little bit of effort in my body to ask them, but I did And we were able to get that. Went to a nearby hotel. I was able to plug in. It was a hostel hotel. It was a little bit difficult, overall. At some moments. In there. It was tough. Right. It's like again, it's like, you know, kinda again, it's like a weird situation Right. And and maybe we can kinda break it open a little. It's just like like this idea that instead of just, you know, okay. We have plan already. We have a plan where it's like, I'm going to you know, go home you know, plan my stuff for tomorrow. Like, I was talking to you and it's like, was going through all this stuff Planning everything for tomorrow. And instead of, like, going home and doing everything from the comfort of my apartment, and air conditioning Even I could go outside and pace around if I wanted to. Instead of doing that, I chose to do it in front of the office, in front of the space. and that type of decision is the type that I am afraid of. Like how can do you know what I mean like I can\u2019t train you know this idea I get it again. I know we\u2019re treading a little bit but just you know forgetting the card right like this is a priority like it\u2019s the only thing that matters is like making sure you have the card OK and then but then not only that OK. Well, you forgot the card so you\u2019re planning the day for the next day that matters now is that you get home so you can sleep and plan for the next day at the main thing so you have a phone you can see the charger is going down and yet you know we take with like what are we doing so I guess I guess there\u2019s that I just can\u2019t wanna chat about that real quick like it\u2019s fucked you know I still like three hours like you know half asleep trying to decide like don\u2019t wanna fucking break into this building like obviously I\u2019m not gonna do that but like I thought about it you know and I\u2019m thinking like so many stoop like I\u2019m like well you know I had that thought and I was like well let\u2019s not like triple down on stupidity and dumb shit right let\u2019s not take more risk so at least I didn\u2019t do that but like you know, I still you know ended up like walking around the street like half tired. I did order a taxi or a bike but like it you know it was one of those scammer bikes were fucking you know drove by and then started his meter. You know my phone was dead so I can\u2019t do anything so it\u2019s just bullshit so I don\u2019t know I kind of feel a little bit bad the girl I am excited about the girl we met randomly outside of the mall when my friend, the friend that I left to go see when he was here yeah we met. I met that girl. I just kind of randomly and she was nice she\u2019s from like Lithuania so it\u2019s like these random it\u2019s a randomly that these clothes are from this countries are nice in general so yeah you know we met. I got her Instagram. I think I sent a couple messages the first day but then I just didn\u2019t say anything because I don\u2019t really pursue too much but she actually messaged me and said like ask what I was doing and so you know one of the days and I said I\u2019m gonna go dancing and she said she wanted to come. We ended up meeting and we didn\u2019t dance at all we just like sat in this fucking you know it was my choice like we sat in this caf\u00e9 and just had like a fucking. I don\u2019t even know what you wanna call it like a chat like a chat while we were just looking into each other\u2018s eyes like a little bit a little bit tense in many ways. It was like a little tense was like like 22 strong people like figuring each other out or something and I don\u2019t know. I was just like sitting there like I don\u2019t know what the fuck to do with this girl and I told her that I really just told her that I was like I don\u2019t know what to do with you. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t usually do this shit and but I am here you know I don\u2019t know it was kind of vulnerable. I don\u2019t you know I kind of regretted in that moment not like afterwards soon afterwards I just don\u2019t like not having control over the situation yeah I just don\u2019t like you know cause when you when you when you like talk about when you really like let the guard down and you like let whatever you want come out of your mouth you\u2019re really seating control over the situation in a way that is dangerous and it\u2019s dangerous in that like somebody can take it to take advantage but like and I could see the places where she was looking at you know kind of having an understanding about me that maybe isn\u2019t accurate or something like that I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what to say about it but anyway the point is what I will say about her is that there was one moment in the middle where she said she wanted to go back to her apartment and to your hotel to get her to change and I cheat and she said I promise I\u2019ll come back in and she did come back, but I remember I started spiraling like while I was waiting for her to come back. I used to recording something and I was like you know just you know start smiling like OK well time to time to like write time to write the song time to put together the hatch time to put together the emotional hatch so I can you know dispel this later in an enjoyable way, but she showed back up and she came back and she was you know kind of you know you know but then yeah so I watched her you know once this place but I don\u2019t wanna talk about it anymore anyway I guess at the end of the day she was what I didn\u2019t really what I she was really strong woman I think and you know the irony. I think I did. I think I did what I was supposed to do. I think I did Fine. I almost wish that I I don\u2019t know. I think it did fine. I guess I think there\u2019s nothing to do I think there\u2019s nothing to do and I think that I can trust that she\u2019s a grown person who actually you know who has autonomy and opinions and and ability to express what she wants in a in a strong way that and I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know. I still think that you could be strategic, but maybe again if I don\u2019t really want to be strategic, I want to express then you know I have to trust anyway that\u2019s near there so and we had a tough day morning. I guess I\u2019m gonna sleep for a little bit and then get up and commence with the plan but yeah I guess I wanted to like circle back on all the stuff and gotta go through. Yeah just that that decision making that like like is there anything that I can do to like to get in front of stuff like like this like stuff like the you know taxi/bike like I feel like I need a checklist for everything in life, but you obviously can\u2019t have that you have to be able to operate you know you have to be able to do things and you can\u2019t have a checklist for everything you have to like. Have a basic level of common sense and I hate that term because it\u2019s meaningly common sense is not common common sense it\u2019s not common but fuck like it\u2019s true like you do need a basic level of common sense so like how do we fucking and is it just and by the way and maybe is it just like a gay you know it can be chalk it up to like it\u2019s human you know what is what it is. You made a mistake but like again you know I just and it may not be part of a trend it. Maybe he\u2019s just a guy you guy makes making mistakes in his life sometimes and you know whatever but at the same time it\u2019s like come on like OK the same day you know we\u2019re solving stuff we\u2019re getting stuff done theoretically we\u2019re coming up with a plan it\u2019s like that day that that\u2019s the day that I get stranded you know with a fucking you know outside of a building with no phone you know what I mean that that\u2019s the magical day. Will that where that happens like make it make sense like obviously it doesn\u2019t. You know what I mean it\u2019s it\u2019s strains credulity can I say that it\u2019s strains credulity to say that this is like a random thing or just like oh everybody has it. It\u2019s like I mean yeah do they do they though like do they though you know do you know what I mean like of course people things happen to people but like do they get stranded at 4 AM at 5 AM in front of the coworker place like do they I mean OK we don\u2019t have to talk about the exact situation but likethis does not happen to people so like what do we do yeah I don\u2019t know just before I go to sleep, I just wanted to we could talk about the plan tomorrow tomorrow but like yeah I just wanted to go through the shit",

					"text": "Hey. Had a little bit of a hiccup to it's 6 o'clock AM. Last time I chatted, I think I sent a message at, like, 2. So I had a little bit of a issue with, a taxi. You know, I, meant to call it sooner, But I didn't and then I ended up stranded for a few hours So I had to, like, walk to the 711 You know? I had to buy a charger. Then you know, I had to ask them for a charger 2 in order to pay, I actually realized that I did have I had my cards, so I could have just paid. But so I didn't have to actually ask them. But still did. You know, it took me a little bit of effort in my body to ask them, but I did And we were able to get that. Went to a nearby hotel. I was able to plug in. It was a hostel hotel. It was a little bit difficult, overall. At some moments. In there. It was tough. Right. It's like again, it's like, you know, kinda again, it's like a weird situation Right. And and maybe we can kinda break it open a little. It's just like like this idea that instead of just, you know, okay. We have plan already. We have a plan where it's like, I'm going to you know, go home you know, plan my stuff for tomorrow. Like, I was talking to you and it's like, was going through all this stuff Planning everything for tomorrow. And instead of, like, going home and doing everything from the comfort of my apartment, and air conditioning Even I could go outside and pace around if I wanted to. Instead of doing that, I chose to do it in front of the office, in front of the space. and that type of decision is the type that I am afraid of. Like how can do you know what I mean like I can\u2019t train you know this idea I get it again. I know we\u2019re treading a little bit but just you know forgetting the card right like this is a priority like it\u2019s the only thing that matters is like making sure you have the card OK and then but then not only that OK. Well, you forgot the card so you\u2019re planning the day for the next day that matters now is that you get home so you can sleep and plan for the next day at the main thing so you have a phone you can see the charger is going down and yet you know we take with like what are we doing so I guess I guess there\u2019s that I just can\u2019t wanna chat about that real quick like it\u2019s fucked you know I still like three hours like you know half asleep trying to decide like don\u2019t wanna fucking break into this building like obviously I\u2019m not gonna do that but like I thought about it you know and I\u2019m thinking like so many stoop like I\u2019m like well you know I had that thought and I was like well let\u2019s not like triple down on stupidity and dumb shit right let\u2019s not take more risk so at least I didn\u2019t do that but like you know, I still you know ended up like walking around the street like half tired. I did order a taxi or a bike but like it you know it was one of those scammer bikes were fucking you know drove by and then started his meter. You know my phone was dead so I can\u2019t do anything so it\u2019s just bullshit so I don\u2019t know I kind of feel a little bit bad the girl I am excited about the girl we met randomly outside of the mall when my friend, the friend that I left to go see when he was here yeah we met. I met that girl. I just kind of randomly and she was nice she\u2019s from like Lithuania so it\u2019s like these random it\u2019s a randomly that these clothes are from this countries are nice in general so yeah you know we met. I got her Instagram. I think I sent a couple messages the first day but then I just didn\u2019t say anything because I don\u2019t really pursue too much but she actually messaged me and said like ask what I was doing and so you know one of the days and I said I\u2019m gonna go dancing and she said she wanted to come. We ended up meeting and we didn\u2019t dance at all we just like sat in this fucking you know it was my choice like we sat in this caf\u00e9 and just had like a fucking. I don\u2019t even know what you wanna call it like a chat like a chat while we were just looking into each other\u2018s eyes like a little bit a little bit tense in many ways. It was like a little tense was like like 22 strong people like figuring each other out or something and I don\u2019t know. I was just like sitting there like I don\u2019t know what the fuck to do with this girl and I told her that I really just told her that I was like I don\u2019t know what to do with you. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t usually do this shit and but I am here you know I don\u2019t know it was kind of vulnerable. I don\u2019t you know I kind of regretted in that moment not like afterwards soon afterwards I just don\u2019t like not having control over the situation yeah I just don\u2019t like you know cause when you when you when you like talk about when you really like let the guard down and you like let whatever you want come out of your mouth you\u2019re really seating control over the situation in a way that is dangerous and it\u2019s dangerous in that like somebody can take it to take advantage but like and I could see the places where she was looking at you know kind of having an understanding about me that maybe isn\u2019t accurate or something like that I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what to say about it but anyway the point is what I will say about her is that there was one moment in the middle where she said she wanted to go back to her apartment and to your hotel to get her to change and I cheat and she said I promise I\u2019ll come back in and she did come back, but I remember I started spiraling like while I was waiting for her to come back. I used to recording something and I was like you know just you know start smiling like OK well time to time to like write time to write the song time to put together the hatch time to put together the emotional hatch so I can you know dispel this later in an enjoyable way, but she showed back up and she came back and she was you know kind of you know you know but then yeah so I watched her you know once this place but I don\u2019t wanna talk about it anymore anyway I guess at the end of the day she was what I didn\u2019t really what I she was really strong woman I think and you know the irony. I think I did. I think I did what I was supposed to do. I think I did Fine. I almost wish that I I don\u2019t know. I think it did fine. I guess I think there\u2019s nothing to do I think there\u2019s nothing to do and I think that I can trust that she\u2019s a grown person who actually you know who has autonomy and opinions and and ability to express what she wants in a in a strong way that and I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know. I still think that you could be strategic, but maybe again if I don\u2019t really want to be strategic, I want to express then you know I have to trust anyway that\u2019s near there so and we had a tough day morning. I guess I\u2019m gonna sleep for a little bit and then get up and commence with the plan but yeah I guess I wanted to like circle back on all the stuff and gotta go through. Yeah just that that decision making that like like is there anything that I can do to like to get in front of stuff like like this like stuff like the you know taxi/bike like I feel like I need a checklist for everything in life, but you obviously can\u2019t have that you have to be able to operate you know you have to be able to do things and you can\u2019t have a checklist for everything you have to like. Have a basic level of common sense and I hate that term because it\u2019s meaningly common sense is not common common sense it\u2019s not common but fuck like it\u2019s true like you do need a basic level of common sense so like how do we fucking and is it just and by the way and maybe is it just like a gay you know it can be chalk it up to like it\u2019s human you know what is what it is. You made a mistake but like again you know I just and it may not be part of a trend it. Maybe he\u2019s just a guy you guy makes making mistakes in his life sometimes and you know whatever but at the same time it\u2019s like come on like OK the same day you know we\u2019re solving stuff we\u2019re getting stuff done theoretically we\u2019re coming up with a plan it\u2019s like that day that that\u2019s the day that I get stranded you know with a fucking you know outside of a building with no phone you know what I mean that that\u2019s the magical day.

			"text": "Well, I wanted to update you on today. Basically, it's, it's 3 o'clock in the morning, 3:30. It's on Monday. So, basically, skip today. You know, Sunday so I'll I'll I'll just you know, since we don't have app made and everything, I'll just kinda go through some stuff and and then whatever. Solid day, I was able to know, we got a lot of, we followed up on a lot of the contacts from the conference. And we got a d we got at least, like, all of the context down on paper. That we had all reached out, you know, that we had met, And that was so that was good. So we're set up generally for success tomorrow, though, we still need to actually, we still need to actually, like, get a plan together as far as Like, who's reaching out to who and what specifically? But, pretty decently productive on that side was able to Get the app get a couple of the features of the app, kind of Not the app. I was able to get a couple things going. What was I gonna say? Yeah. You know, we we mentioned a couple of the features, for the for the thing. So I was able to get a couple of those not exactly done, not ready, not production ready. Because when I said they were coded, it was true they are coded, but you know, in order to make them, you know, I realized they're they're coated, but they're, like, coated for superbaits. Or super base, not for, the notion So I need to, kinda modify it to make sure they're ready actually connected to the notion database. So that, but but but as far as it goes, you know, we're we're we're in decent shape overall. I had a, a couple of the updates, couple of the updates, for the personal relationship stuff, you know, I had a good conversation with, the one girl that I mentioned it's kinda nice, just bullshit. She went to, Copangang which is like an island in Thailand. And we were kind of bullshitting about different things, in that That was kinda nice, just to bullshit a little bit. You know, we're talking back and forth. We got a little little mini serious conversation, little mini Let me grab some tea. A little mini thing about, you know, like, I I I you know, little mini vulnerability in decks there. About, she asked me about pain or violence or something. That's how she randomly texts me. You know, like, if I felt how I felt about pain or something like that, And I kinda opened up a little bit about she asked me about violent pain specifically Claude if I liked, like, inflicting it or feeling it or something like that. And I think I was kinda honest. You know? I was like, mean, pain is good and bad. I mean, sometimes I like to inflict it, but not emotionally and not in a not a spiritually, but, you know, physically sometimes, like, it's like in a sexual way. Right? But then I told her, like, asked me if I liked it actually. And I was like, well, yes, but it's like, weird didn't iOS say? And she was like, well, why? And I was like, well, so I'll wind up a little bit about my father and And I was just used to abuse my mother a little bit when I was younger, and and, so I opened up a little bit about that in text. I asked her if she wanna do a call, but she said she was she was busy. So so we opened up a little bit and, you know, exchanged some stuff, and then she asked me for some advice. On some coat. And, it was a nice little interaction, nice little interaction. So that's nice, kind of really drum rolling you know, when her coming back, I guess, in many ways, I still don't really know But, hey, listen. I'm excited. I guess I don't wanna, like, overplay it, but I was, but also I feel a little But I feel do you wanna say? I feel nervous that I guess it's, I don't I feel nervous that I don't actually I don't know. I I feel nervous about sex. And You know, having sex with her and Because in general, these days, I just don't really I don't I haven't really enjoying sex many situations. Probably the last few times I've had sex, I've Not really enjoyed it. You know, it's been way more of a kind of a almost a third party experience where it's like, I'm not really like, I'm I'm I don't know how to describe it. What makes me uncomfortable makes me uncomfortable. To talk about. But it's not, yeah, it's not something I really enjoy. It's more something I'm doing, and I'm a little bit disgusted by it. A little bit Like, it's disgusting, and it's like, It's dumb. And it's disgusting, but I'm doing it because whatever It's because I'm supposed to, because we're supposed to do it. And honestly, because it feels good, but I'm kinda disgusted by it in many ways. Think that's the word I wanna use I'm not like it's not it's not I'm looking and maybe it's because of who I'm having sex with. Maybe as well. It might be that it might be something like that instead of the actual sex act. Per se. But who knows? I can't know because, you know, I've needed more diverse set of people to have sex with or so or something like that. I did have a oh, I forgot about this. Oh, I really had a such a this girl iOS so joyous. It's just such a pleasure. And Android, okay. And then so this girl, it's a newer one, and it's kinda crazy that I'm just, like, meeting women now. It's like I never meet women. Okay? Because I don't go out. But I met one more at the conference, and she's like the CFO or COO. Whatever and it's not like a real thing, but it's she's like she's making decent money at this company, and she's but she's so first of all, of course, she's, like, really pretty. Right? She's, like, extremely pretty. Okay? But, further than that, she's, she's, like, wow. She's like, has some joy, you know, and she smiles, and she's silly, and she's sexy, and she's kinda fun, and she's silly. And goofy. And it's kind of fun. It's fun to to text people like that. It's fun to interact with people. And you know, I have, like, a trepidation. It's a trepidation. I have a trepidation. Trepidation. I have a trepidation like kind of you know, overindulging or like being know, kinda being myself with these people. You know, like, like I just sent her way too many video messages, like way too many. We're really going back and forth. And, you know, like, go 3 messages, 3 messages, 4 messages, whatever. Like, going back and forth, and then she asked me, like, a bunch of questions at once. And I was gonna call her, but it just didn't don't know. She was about to smoke weed and go to sleep. So I was like, let me just but I sent her, like, I don't know, 7 or 8 or something. But then I sent her a few texts. But so it's like I feel You know? Often I feel trepidation you know, because that's not the correct way to behave. I'll say something, I'll say that I'll say it like that. I'll say it like that. That's not the you know, that's not the recommended behavior for and and even if I'm coaching or if I'm giving advice or if I'm doing anything, I Say, do not send 12 video messages to the girl Just send, like, 2 or 3 and request for a video call, and know what I mean? I'd I'd say something more reasonable and yet know, here I am set sending 20 video messages or 8 or whatever it was. So that's a I don't know. I don't know what you wanna make of that. I I kind of, feel like I should, I don't know. Oh, look. Know, in in the end, you know, you know, even I think about, okay, this is the right way or the wrong way. And in the end, Like, with this thing with these girls, like, don't know. The girl that, I thought maybe I should have pushed harder okay. There's 2 there's 3 girls here, you know. One of them didn't text back at all. We talked about her already. But this other one, like I thought that I probably should have pushed harder or I should have done more and and I still think I should have, but at the same time, she's still texting me, she still likes me. So you know, maybe it's fine. Right? Look. I guess it was fine. Right? In the end, it was fine. So it\u2019s just an interesting thing just to like I don\u2019t know my brain can catastrophize things before. They are bad and critique things before. They are even really available for critique like my brain will just go ahead and say OK well you should\u2019ve done that better and it\u2019s like Based on what based on not even really based on the outcome based on the feeling that I get after I did it and not necessarily based on the outcome so that\u2019s something that\u2019s something that\u2019s something that is you know and I think that\u2019s pretty common. I think I think it\u2019s pretty common socially with people with people made with some social anxiety. the irony is like you know you know how many years many years later I\u2019m know it was a crazy guy before and many is after learning all this stuff like I guess I still have this like thing of social anxiety I guess But More this trigger in my brain of catastrophic things but anyway, no I don\u2019t wanna make it negative I had a super interesting interaction with two girls and think I like them both and and I\u2019m kind of excited for the future. I don\u2019t of course they both know one lives in Israel one lives in fucking like Lithuania so like what are you gonna do but and I live in Thailand, butbut I mean, you know there\u2019s there\u2019s planes and stuff and you know it\u2019s interesting that you can still meet people that you can like you know I just felt like I just felt like for a little bit of time there that it was just kind of you know illusory to meet somebody else but of course it\u2019s possible. Of course it\u2019s doable and yeah, so anyway I\u2019m gonna go back well I\u2019m gonna send this and then I wanna see what you think or what you have to say so I mean yeah I know I don\u2019t know what you wanna count as my small wings but definitely you know I didn\u2019t get through. I probably still have like I don\u2019t know 30 or so like unread messages and so I\u2019m just trying to truck through all of those tonight, you know I think I might pull like a two deer you know I don\u2019t know how you feel about me doing that in general but I like to do that sometimes I like to just go stay up like 48 hours and just try to do as much work as possible, but I\u2019m interested in your perspective on me doing stuff like that but you know in general I like to do it but if it\u2019s whenever it\u2019s possible but yeah other than that I don\u2019t I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much else. Yeah I kind of miss oh I will say this is just random. This is just random just random thing the main software that I was using the code they fucking they added like a pay like a paywall thing so like before I mean, I remember cause I was using it a lot and I was like there\u2019s no way that it\u2019s gonna stay this unlimited. There\u2019s no way because they\u2019re they have to be staff to be shedding money They have to be shedding money and lo and behold eventually boom day has come so here we are yeah so I know it\u2019s like 10,000 a month maybe more I think the $10 a month. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna be enough but I think it\u2019s probably like kind of enough in many ways And I already pay a few things for a few things. I mean you listen everything is bright is bright. the girl asked me that\u2019s what she asked me a question like do I like my job and I was like my work no I don\u2019t you know I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. We already talked about a lot of stuff so let\u2019s just yeah let\u2019s wrap this is my kind of update thing and let me know what you think an expert and interested in your perspective on all the stuff.. by the way, yeah I know this is coming to you as text, but I\u2019m speaking to it like a speech to text thing so I think the transcription is definitely not perfect so just wear that bear in mind like I\u2019m not dumb. I just I\u2019m not you know I\u2019m just speaking and it\u2019s not probably getting everything exactly correct so that\u2019s whatever.",

					"text": "Well, I wanted to update you on today. Basically, it's, it's 3 o'clock in the morning, 3:30. It's on Monday. So, basically, skip today. You know, Sunday so I'll I'll I'll just you know, since we don't have app made and everything, I'll just kinda go through some stuff and and then whatever. Solid day, I was able to know, we got a lot of, we followed up on a lot of the contacts from the conference. And we got a d we got at least, like, all of the context down on paper. That we had all reached out, you know, that we had met, And that was so that was good. So we're set up generally for success tomorrow, though, we still need to actually, we still need to actually, like, get a plan together as far as Like, who's reaching out to who and what specifically? But, pretty decently productive on that side was able to Get the app get a couple of the features of the app, kind of Not the app. I was able to get a couple things going. What was I gonna say? Yeah. You know, we we mentioned a couple of the features, for the for the thing. So I was able to get a couple of those not exactly done, not ready, not production ready. Because when I said they were coded, it was true they are coded, but you know, in order to make them, you know, I realized they're they're coated, but they're, like, coated for superbaits. Or super base, not for, the notion So I need to, kinda modify it to make sure they're ready actually connected to the notion database. So that, but but but as far as it goes, you know, we're we're we're in decent shape overall. I had a, a couple of the updates, couple of the updates, for the personal relationship stuff, you know, I had a good conversation with, the one girl that I mentioned it's kinda nice, just bullshit. She went to, Copangang which is like an island in Thailand. And we were kind of bullshitting about different things, in that That was kinda nice, just to bullshit a little bit. You know, we're talking back and forth. We got a little little mini serious conversation, little mini Let me grab some tea. A little mini thing about, you know, like, I I I you know, little mini vulnerability in decks there. About, she asked me about pain or violence or something. That's how she randomly texts me. You know, like, if I felt how I felt about pain or something like that, And I kinda opened up a little bit about she asked me about violent pain specifically Claude if I liked, like, inflicting it or feeling it or something like that. And I think I was kinda honest. You know? I was like, mean, pain is good and bad. I mean, sometimes I like to inflict it, but not emotionally and not in a not a spiritually, but, you know, physically sometimes, like, it's like in a sexual way. Right? But then I told her, like, asked me if I liked it actually. And I was like, well, yes, but it's like, weird didn't iOS say? And she was like, well, why? And I was like, well, so I'll wind up a little bit about my father and And I was just used to abuse my mother a little bit when I was younger, and and, so I opened up a little bit about that in text. I asked her if she wanna do a call, but she said she was she was busy. So so we opened up a little bit and, you know, exchanged some stuff, and then she asked me for some advice. On some coat. And, it was a nice little interaction, nice little interaction. So that's nice, kind of really drum rolling you know, when her coming back, I guess, in many ways, I still don't really know But, hey, listen. I'm excited. I guess I don't wanna, like, overplay it, but I was, but also I feel a little But I feel do you wanna say? I feel nervous that I guess it's, I don't I feel nervous that I don't actually I don't know. I I feel nervous about sex. And You know, having sex with her and Because in general, these days, I just don't really I don't I haven't really enjoying sex many situations.

That's not the you know, that's not the recommended behavior for and and even if I'm coaching or if I'm giving advice or if I'm doing anything, I Say, do not send 12 video messages to the girl Just send, like, 2 or 3 and request for a video call, and know what I mean?

			"text": "Let's do let's do 1. For sure. Because I'm super interested in that. Man, I I guess as a bigger question, what Okay. You know, when you see, like, a big pattern, like, these are like, huge patterns, like, that we've identified in the last couple days. Like, what do okay. You know, what's what are you what are you what are we supposed to do with such things? I always wondered with kind of I don't know. It's not like therapy. Right? But it's just help. Right? What do people do with such things? Like, just identify like a huge fucking like, behavior pattern. Like, what do you do with what do you you know, are you supposed to write it down somewhere? Like, what are you supposed to do with these ins like, I guess we kind of have something where, like, you k. You come up with, like, practical thing. I guess part of the answer is, like, know, held in the idea of, like, you know, we create this platform that, you know, I'm able to use to to, you know, track and keep you know, kinda keep track of everything and and, and then you know, gain some insights and some understanding of myself. But I guess yeah. I mean, I guess so that's part of the answer, but, like, truly, just as a general question, like, What are people supposed to do with this stuff? Because it's like, it's fucking it does feel insane. It's like, fuck it. Jesus Christ. You're just, like, reading my head He's reading my head there. Holy shit. You know what I mean? It's that's like the feelings, like, damn. You're, like, fucking you see me. Right? Yeah. I guess what you're supposed to do with that. And then yeah. Can we go under number I mean, can we go under the sexual stuff a little bit more? Like, I don't know really know what to do with it, but I kinda wanna I kinda wanna Like, I don't know. I wanna figure that out or I wanna, like, have, like, a I wanna be ready for it. In Claude. Because, like, I don't want to, you know, I don't wanna on the Same path. That I've been on. You know, I don't wanna have another, like, empty experience And I don't wanna, and I don't wanna resent any, but, no, obviously, I don't not that I resent people per se. I don't wanna use that terminology, but I don't wanna have another feeling of, like, you know, you just have sex and you're just, like, nah. You know? Just to you know, it's just kinda like a throw away. I don't wanna have another, like, throw away thing I'm very Kind of nervous about the throwaway thing and, you know, to be honest, you know, goes, I don't know. I'm scared of making the connections sometimes. I don't know if I'm, like, jumping the shark and making the connection. But my thought was just now, like, okay. Know, we talked about being afraid of success or you know, we talked about being afraid of success. We talked about being afraid, you know, afraid of You know, being being, being being in the potential something that I you know, I guess really enjoy In in many ways, I I don't know By the way, would say correct me. Correct me on the insights or on the connections. And be opinionated. Be very opinionated because I mean, I I forget things. And I don't want to, while it's experience and everything is, my and my my perspective and experience is valuable. I still, I still want to kinda hold fast and hold hard to the things that we've kind of identified in the in the way in the way we're we're moving in general. I don't really wanna get necessarily derailed by, like, an incorrect understanding of, of a cycle or of a behavior. So just like be hard Be like hard lined on on, you know, your opinion or your perspective on different things because I appreciate the guidance. Yeah. I'd love to work on the sex thing because it's just like that's a little bit of a scary you know, it was something that was really important to me at at a time. And, I think it could be enjoyable Android could be wonderful, but definitely do way I've been engaging with it for a while, feel like the last, like, year or 2. It's just, like, this not I don't even say a year or 2, probably longer. I mean, guess when I came 2022 is the last time I probably really kinda had sex and I really kinda enjoyed it in some ways. And why did I enjoy it? When did I last and really enjoy Like having sex with a Someone could really enjoy I don't know. Like, I'm sure I have. Just I would need to look at at my journal or something mean, I enjoyed it a few weeks ago. No. I mean, I enjoy it from time to time. I Do I do because it's like, yeah, I enjoy from time I do. I do. And so I can't say, like, all sex is just, you know, kind of this, like, Disgusting See, like you know, it's more certain Yeah. It's just more certain I guess, times or certain ones certain guess, not certain certain certain Pieces certain specific experiences. Of it. And it's not even less isolated with those specific person. It's more like oh, this time, we have sex didn't you know, discuss anything, didn't like it, don't like it, don't wanna do it, Just like other times, like, oh, okay. This is, like, okay. And I guess I could go into detail a little bit. I mean, it's a little bit it's a little bit like I guess it's a little bit it's a little bit nasty. I don't wanna say it, but I'll say it. I'm gonna go outside real quick. I don't even wanna say it. So I guess it's like With this one particular girl, it's like I guess, in general, I've really enjoyed you know, there's a couple girls that I slept with and I enjoyed like, when we were in Bed and the lights were, like, completely off. And Like, they let me fuck them, like, you know, just, like, kinda take I don't know, take you know, I don't know. It kinda felt it feels like you know, Sounds fucked up. Okay? I'm just gonna say it. I'm just gonna say I'm just gonna say it. It's like a sleeping it's like a kind of a sleeping She's not they're not sleeping right, but it kinda feels like wrong in that way. It's like okay. This sleeping girl, like, you can, you know, you can, like, you know, pull her pants down and fuck her a little bit. Or something, and, it's a little bit fucked up. But of it's kinda like a You know, it's kinda like, you know, and they and they like it a little bit and you know, and it feels good obviously. And come I don't know. Kind of a weird weird thing. I don't know. I don't know if I'm psycho well, psychological psychologizing that one. That might be bit of a psychology psychologizing it. I don't know exactly why like that one that particular form of the sex, I guess. But, like, Definitely, like, Boomerang actively having sex, like, in the kitchen or in the fucking living room, all this shit where I can, like, do all the stuff. Like, I don't like any of that. I don't like any of that. For sure. I don't like any of that. Like, I'm pretty sure I don't like any of that. I don't know. I'm saying that now I'm trying to remember those moments if I if it's if that's true or not, But at least thinking about it now, I'm like, disgusted by it. So I don't know if it was always like that, but I don't think it always was I think before, I mean, I was, like, way more into it. It's like a Different vibe. But now that I'm not as into it, it's like expose it's like exposing its edges of you know, what I, you know, what you know, just you know, I don't know. I could see more, I guess. I have, like, stress in my in my throat. I have to, like, breathe a little bit to speak a little bit. I have, like, a weight on my chest for no fucking I don't know. For no fucking reason yet. So Look at big weight. Trying to breathe it off. Yeah. Yeah. And then I'm definitely interested in your in your perspective on the 48 hour plan because I I do think, you're probably right about the control reset pattern. So, like, instead of yeah. I mean, you're probably you know, it's not you're probably right. Like, right, like, I prefer to Claude. You know, crazy hard and stay up for 2 days you know, as kind of like it's kinda feels like a reset every day, you know? Every time you get to But yeah, you know every time you get those 18 you know you get those yeah every time it feels like a reset but you know if you only have a 16 or 18 hours you know it\u2019s limited you really have to fucking get your shit done in that timeframe and that\u2019s that sucks. I guess I don\u2019t know there\u2019s so much. I guess that I just I feel locked. I feel locked in. I feel I feel like I\u2019m yeah I feel like I\u2019m in a cage or I\u2019m locked in the iron. Is that locked in that phrase is kind of like it\u2019s a kind of a good phrase now in the culture if you\u2019re locked in means like it means that you\u2019re focused, you know you\u2019re locked in but anyway that\u2019s funny that I\u2019m using it as a bad thing but it\u2019s actually kind of like a positive thing in other things but it anywayyeah I kind of feel claustrophobic if I only have my my 16 hours or my 18 hours like fuck but I really you know I don\u2019t have that much time anyway let\u2019s go through all that",

You know, when you see, like, a big pattern, like, these are like, huge patterns, like, that we've identified in the last couple days. Like, what do okay. You know, what's what are you what are you what are we supposed to do with such things? I always wondered with kind of I don't know. It's not like therapy. Right? But it's just help. Right? What do people do with such things? Like, just identify like a huge fucking like, behavior pattern. Like, what do you do with what do you you know, are you supposed to write it down somewhere? Like, what are you supposed to do with these ins like, I guess we kind of have something where, like, you k. You come up with, like, practical thing. I guess part of the answer is, like, know, held in the idea of, like, you know, we create this platform that, you know, I'm able to use to to, you know, track and keep you know, kinda keep track of everything and and, and then you know, gain some insights and some understanding of myself. But I guess yeah. I mean, I guess so that's part of the answer, but, like, truly, just as a general question, like, What are people supposed to do with this stuff? Because it's like, it's fucking it does feel insane. It's like, fuck it. Jesus Christ. You're just, like, reading my head He's reading my head there. Holy shit. You know what I mean? It's that's like the feelings, like, damn. You're, like, fucking you see me. Right? Yeah. I guess what you're supposed to do with that. And then yeah. Can we go under number I mean, can we go under the sexual stuff a little bit more? Like, I don't know really know what to do with it, but I kinda wanna I kinda wanna Like, I don't know. I wanna figure that out or I wanna, like, have, like, a I wanna be ready for it. In Claude. Because, like, I don't want to, you know, I don't wanna on the Same path. That I've been on. You know, I don't wanna have another, like, empty experience And I don't wanna, and I don't wanna resent any, but, no, obviously, I don't not that I resent people per se. I don't wanna use that terminology, but I don't wanna have another feeling of, like, you know, you just have sex and you're just, like, nah. You know? Just to you know, it's just kinda like a throw away. I don't wanna have another, like, throw away thing I'm very Kind of nervous about the throwaway thing and, you know, to be honest, you know, goes, I don't know. I'm scared of making the connections sometimes. I don't know if I'm, like, jumping the shark and making the connection. But my thought was just now, like, okay. Know, we talked about being afraid of success or you know, we talked about being afraid of success. We talked about being afraid, you know, afraid of You know, being being, being being in the potential something that I you know, I guess really enjoy In in many ways, I I don't know By the way, would say correct me. Correct me on the insights or on the connections. And be opinionated. Be very opinionated because I mean, I I forget things. And I don't want to, while it's experience and everything is, my and my my perspective and experience is valuable.

			"text": " Let me break down the key difference between strategic preparation and reactive control:\n\n**Healthy Strategic Preparation vs Reactive Control**\n\n```\nSTRATEGIC PREPARATION\nPurpose: Enhance experience\nFocus: Possibilities\nTimeframe: Future-oriented\nFlexibility: Built-in adaptation\nGoal: Better engagement\n\nvs\n\nREACTIVE CONTROL\nPurpose: Prevent discomfort\nFocus: Limitations\nTimeframe: Escape present\nFlexibility: Rigid rules\nGoal: Avoid vulnerability\n```\n\nLet's use specific scenarios to illustrate:\n\n1. **Intimate Encounter Planning**\n```\nStrategic:\n- \"I'll start in my comfort zone (darkness) and explore from there\"\n- Have options for increasing connection\n- Allow natural progression\n- Keep breathing protocol ready\n\nReactive:\n- Must stay dark\n- Must follow specific script\n- Shut down if deviating\n- Escape at first discomfort\n```\n\n2. **Work Planning**\n```\nStrategic:\n- \"I'll block 4 focused hours, then assess\"\n- Have clear deliverables but flexible approach\n- Built-in breaks and assessment points\n- Room for unexpected opportunities\n\nReactive:\n- Must work 48 hours\n- Must finish everything now\n- No room for adjustment\n- All or nothing approach\n```\n\n3. **Communication Planning**\n```\nStrategic:\n- \"I'll be authentic within these boundaries\"\n- Pre-plan topics you're comfortable discussing\n- Have connection points identified\n- Allow natural flow within safe structure\n\nReactive:\n- Must follow \"rules\" of interaction\n- Count messages sent\n- Judge against ideal behavior\n- Self-criticism for authenticity\n```\n\n**Key Differences in Practice:**\n\n1. **Flexibility vs Rigidity**\n```\nStrategic has IF/THEN plans:\n\"If I feel overwhelmed, then I'll...\"\n\"If connection deepens, then I might...\"\n\nReactive has MUST/NEVER rules:\n\"Must maintain control\"\n\"Never show vulnerability\"\n```\n\n2. **Purpose of Planning**\n```\nStrategic:\n- Creates safety for exploration\n- Builds confidence through preparation\n- Allows for growth\n\nReactive:\n- Prevents any surprise\n- Maintains tight boundaries\n- Avoids growth\n```\n\n3. **Response to Unexpected**\n```\nStrategic:\n- Assess if safe\n- Use prepared tools\n- Make conscious choice\n\nReactive:\n- Immediate retreat\n- Reset everything\n- Abandon progress\n```\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Design a specific strategic plan for an upcoming encounter?\n2. Create IF/THEN protocols for common scenarios?\n3. Practice converting reactive rules to strategic plans?\n\nThe key is that strategic preparation creates a safe container for authentic experience, while reactive control tries to eliminate the possibility of authentic experience entirely.\n\nRemember: The goal isn't to eliminate control - it's to make it serve connection rather than prevent it.",

					"text": " Let me break down the key difference between strategic preparation and reactive control:\n\n**Healthy Strategic Preparation vs Reactive Control**\n\n```\nSTRATEGIC PREPARATION\nPurpose: Enhance experience\nFocus: Possibilities\nTimeframe: Future-oriented\nFlexibility: Built-in adaptation\nGoal: Better engagement\n\nvs\n\nREACTIVE CONTROL\nPurpose: Prevent discomfort\nFocus: Limitations\nTimeframe: Escape present\nFlexibility: Rigid rules\nGoal: Avoid vulnerability\n```\n\nLet's use specific scenarios to illustrate:\n\n1. **Intimate Encounter Planning**\n```\nStrategic:\n- \"I'll start in my comfort zone (darkness) and explore from there\"\n- Have options for increasing connection\n- Allow natural progression\n- Keep breathing protocol ready\n\nReactive:\n- Must stay dark\n- Must follow specific script\n- Shut down if deviating\n- Escape at first discomfort\n```\n\n2. **Work Planning**\n```\nStrategic:\n- \"I'll block 4 focused hours, then assess\"\n- Have clear deliverables but flexible approach\n- Built-in breaks and assessment points\n- Room for unexpected opportunities\n\nReactive:\n- Must work 48 hours\n- Must finish everything now\n- No room for adjustment\n- All or nothing approach\n```\n\n3. **Communication Planning**\n```\nStrategic:\n- \"I'll be authentic within these boundaries\"\n- Pre-plan topics you're comfortable discussing\n- Have connection points identified\n- Allow natural flow within safe structure\n\nReactive:\n- Must follow \"rules\" of interaction\n- Count messages sent\n- Judge against ideal behavior\n- Self-criticism for authenticity\n```\n\n**Key Differences in Practice:**\n\n1. **Flexibility vs Rigidity**\n```\nStrategic has IF/THEN plans:\n\"If I feel overwhelmed, then I'll...\"\n\"If connection deepens, then I might...\"\n\nReactive has MUST/NEVER rules:\n\"Must maintain control\"\n\"Never show vulnerability\"\n```\n\n2. **Purpose of Planning**\n```\nStrategic:\n- Creates safety for exploration\n- Builds confidence through preparation\n- Allows for growth\n\nReactive:\n- Prevents any surprise\n- Maintains tight boundaries\n- Avoids growth\n```\n\n3. **Response to Unexpected**\n```\nStrategic:\n- Assess if safe\n- Use prepared tools\n- Make conscious choice\n\nReactive:\n- Immediate retreat\n- Reset everything\n- Abandon progress\n```\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Design a specific strategic plan for an upcoming encounter?\n2. Create IF/THEN protocols for common scenarios?\n3. Practice converting reactive rules to strategic plans?\n\nThe key is that strategic preparation creates a safe container for authentic experience, while reactive control tries to eliminate the possibility of authentic experience entirely.\n\nRemember: The goal isn't to eliminate control - it's to make it serve connection rather than prevent it."

I said I had that meeting, but that meeting kinda late and ended up being, like, probably it ended up kind of running into the work So I wasn't able to really get a 4 sleep. And so I'm a little bit tired. Going into everything, Yeah. Anyway, at least had to disappoint. I don't know. I mean, this businessman It's it's, I don't know. I mean, I don't know if I'm good at it. I mean, I'll that's the honest thing. You know, it's like a whole bunch of where it's like you kinda have to promise people stuff and then know, you have to promise people these deals and And then these deals don't work out, and and You know, there's no traffic because, you know, Facebook decides, you know, to pause the account or to not let the account work. I don't know. Anyway, so just back to where I was at. Yeah. Basically, you know, I kinda ran into the workday. I guess the small wins is, well, you know, wins and losses. Right? I was able to, you know, get, some deals for today. But I also made a mistake and I thought I booked a deal for Singapore, and I did not. And I mislabeled some stuff and then So know, so it's a little bit, and and and again, type of thing again. Listen, I don't wanna connect everything to, like, fucking meta mistakes, but because humans just make mistakes. Right? But yeah, I don't know. So I made some mistakes. You know, I I don't really and I can't you know, the for the life of me, Can't can't tell you. It's possible to make the mistake Can't tell you how it's possible because there's too many checks. Like, I don't even it's not possible. Literally, I have to like, I have to read the chat, and I see the you know, I see the and then I have to put it into the system. K? And then I have to and then I have to give the person a confirmation text of the thing. And it's like there's 5 steps n at at no point anybody if nobody catches anything, it's like, how does this even work? I just don't know. Yeah. So that's whatever. It's a little bit frustrating to make mistakes and Have it bullshit. So and and in general, it's like a little bit Stressful mini. I mean, listen, man. I have, like, Jesus. I don't know how many unread chats. Like, 50? Like, just Always like so many. And you can't catch I guess, like, you know, at the end of the week, like, next week by next week, maybe we'll have caught up on all of them. Maybe. You know? We'll have finally gotten to the bottom and people will kind of have relaxed a little bit enough to, you know, People will I will have relaxed a little bit enough to, like, whatever. But Yeah. So a small win was able to do that. We have a plan You know? I'm supposed to start in 30 minutes on contacting the new new leads. All the new brands, all saw the new potential customers on the other business. So, basically, yeah, there's 2 sides of the business, like, on this one side, it's, like, basically, I was working this morning. Basically, gonna start working the other side. I wanted, like, a 30 minute gap in between, and I'm gonna try to take it But I you know, It's not gonna end up being a 30 minute gap. It's just gonna be me going into the office, getting some food, and kinda eating on the run, and then starting to hit the chats again, in 30 minutes. So not really maybe I'll have, like, a 15 minute thing of just eating. Which I will take. It's better than Anthropic. And then we can hit everything again but mainly on the other side and just try to keep it going. And try to fight to get because that business is, like, kinda falling, but they both are. You know? And they really need you know? I don't I feel lies on me, and I don't know if I Rise to the occasion. I the irony is, like, I really pride myself I think I pride myself on, like, the ability to have a system of working on being able to handle a large amount of Different things. You know, that other people wouldn't be able to handle. And here I am, like, kind of underwater in many ways on these things. Like, I'm not good. I'm just not doing this. Well, I don't I I I and I think that's objective. I think people can see it. Just not doing this well. I could. You know? So anyway, man, maybe I mean, my heart's not in it probably, but it is a matter. Right? It's not about your RB and it ain't. I still gotta fucking perform. You know what I mean? So you know, gives a fuck about your heart. Like, perform. Continued conversations with a couple girl the couple girls just small text. You know? The girl the one girl did respond to my 7, like, voice messages I don't know if you have context of everything, if you remember everything. But, yeah, I'll I'll just differentiate. Yeah. Claudia is the girl that I met and she is she she's, she's from Lithuania. She's, like, a politician type of thing. Way harder, kinda harder if you wanna say that, like, harder exterior, kinda more serious, but, like, she's silly. She's kinda fun. I I like her. She's the kinda one that, you know, I met first out of all 3 of the girls. Then there's a second girl. I don't know her name because you know, and then, you know, the one that goes with me. And there's a third one. I actually don't know her name fully. I think it's Emmett. AMIT, or something like that. I think it's Emmett. Have something. And but she has, anyway, so I've been going back and forth with her and and, it's it's genuinely wonderful. Was wonderful. Interact with her. It's fun. So, yeah. What else? Is there anything else? Shave my head. You know? Kinda cleaned up my face a little bit so we got some level of, like, hygiene. I changed the shirt and sweater that I've been wearing for the past few days. So I'm not wearing a shirt right now, but I'll put on a new shirt. So I'll at least have that I didn't shower. But You know? I don't know. That's a lot. I I'll shower. Know? I'll shower. Okay. I'll shower before I leave. I'll take, like, a 5 minute shower. Other than that, yeah, man. I don't know. Okay. One second. Let me respond to this girl. She said I can't respond to everything. Second. Let me respond to her. Yeah. Can you just go over that a little bit? I don't know. Tough.",

I also want thing that I'm doing that Don't necessarily dislike I don't know. I mean, I drink soda. Which isn't probably good for you overall. But I drink it. It's like my small pleasure. Anyway, I drink a soda along with it's like a 2 liter. It's a big one, actually. Been a even a 3 liter. I don't know how To 1 liter. To 1 liter. Okay. Yeah. So I got some food. It's pretty good. Food was healthy, though. I will say So yeah, I got some food. Started going through I didn't start going through anything yet. It's it's 6 o'clock, so I'm like 1 hour kinda late where I was supposed to kinda start. But, We're gonna start, now. On Going through messages. I have around I have 60 unread chats at the moment. Something around 60 and that's not including, you know, any of the probably 30 or so that I have to well, I guess, I have to probably create 60 new ones my own. So if you can imagine, you know, we're already Like Eve. And we have to probably make 60 more. So it's probably what I'm probably I'm probably have to do it at a measured pace because It's already a little bit overwhelmed Yeah. No. There's a lot of shit. There's a little too much. So because there's 2 businesses. So we're gonna have to I'm thinking that We just go ahead and try to hit, like, 10 a day. Or 20. I think 20. Because that way we'd be able to get through all of them a week. In the next 3 days, we'll be able to open most of them. So if we did 20 a day, then we're just then we're really cooking. That allows some level of, and then I think the other thing that I need to start doing is, I started doing a little bit, but just harder. Is like one task gonna call it, like, a one task thing. Where it's like, basically, 1 you know, if I'm supposed to do something for 1 chat, like find a deal then I do that thing. Yeah. Boom. We do the thing. No distraction. We have to get that one task Done. Until we move before we move on to the next task. That's probably what I'm gonna do because I did notice that I I'm saying to some people, like, hey. I'm gonna do this. And then I'm moving off of the chat and going to do other stuff and then Not doing the thing because forgot about it. Or, you know, you just procrastinate, I guess. I find Even this evening, actually, probably around midnight, I would like to put to I would like to do an hour of clothing stuff just so, like, I need to clean that world up and just because there's fabric waiting places and it's just like, it needs to be cleaned up. We need to send fabric we need to organize the sending of fabric. To, You know, 22 2 different suppliers. And, yeah, yeah. So I would like to do that. Okay. Set up that. As of now, gonna try. I know think we talked about natural energy levels or something like that. But you know, I am a little bit Tired. To what extent I guess, to what extent do you think it's important to stay natural per se? And then, like, when when is, like, Good. The, caffeine, you know, when we do have Adderall, like, when do these things, when do When can they? Should they be used? Should I be avoiding them? You know, what would be, like, the off ramp for those things? Or, you know, does there need to be an off ramp for those things? You know, should we We just keep pushing. Well, Just, Yeah. Yeah, I guess lots of stuff there. But, yeah, we're about to have just a mega push let me know what you think of that idea, or if you there's, like, a more optimal plan Again, you know, you're you're super opinionated.

I also want thing that I'm doing that Don't necessarily dislike I don't know. I mean, I drink soda. Which isn't probably good for you overall. But I drink it. It's like my small pleasure. Anyway, I drink a soda along with it's like a 2 liter. It's a big one, actually. Been a even a 3 liter. I don't know how To 1 liter. To 1 liter. Okay. Yeah. So I got some food. It's pretty good. Food was healthy, though. I will say So yeah, I got some food. Started going through I didn't start going through anything yet. It's it's 6 o'clock, so I'm like 1 hour kinda late where I was supposed to kinda start. But, We're gonna start, now. On Going through messages. I have around I have 60 unread chats at the moment. Something around 60 and that's not including, you know, any of the probably 30 or so that I have to well, I guess, I have to probably create 60 new ones my own. So if you can imagine, you know, we're already Like Eve. And we have to probably make 60 more. So it's probably what I'm probably I'm probably have to do it at a measured pace because It's already a little bit overwhelmed Yeah. No. There's a lot of shit. There's a little too much. So because there's 2 businesses. So we're gonna have to I'm thinking that We just go ahead and try to hit, like, 10 a day. Or 20. I think 20. Because that way we'd be able to get through all of them a week. In the next 3 days, we'll be able to open most of them. So if we did 20 a day, then we're just then we're really cooking. That allows some level of, and then I think the other thing that I need to start doing is, I started doing a little bit, but just harder. Is like one task gonna call it, like, a one task thing. Where it's like, basically, 1 you know, if I'm supposed to do something for 1 chat, like find a deal then I do that thing. Yeah. Boom. We do the thing. No distraction. We have to get that one task Done. Until we move before we move on to the next task. That's probably what I'm gonna do because I did notice that I I'm saying to some people, like, hey. I'm gonna do this. And then I'm moving off of the chat and going to do other stuff and then Not doing the thing because forgot about it. Or, you know, you just procrastinate, I guess.

I might Just hit it a little bit later. Just because but, I mean, I guess you I could just stop at 10 as well and, starting in the next day. This is just as easy So that, you know, To your point, guess I could do that. Nothing's stopping me from doing that. Not bad. So Still, you know, just a ridiculous amount of chats. I did recruit one of my new coworkers to kinda lead a couple of the initiatives to see if he could Kinda open some stuff and get some things going. Looks like he was able to get one thing going, but the other one, no. But I don't know. I don't think necessarily that, it would have changed with me doing it. So you know, it's fine. What else? Small development. Feels listen. And I know I struggle with the vulnerability, and I go back and forth. And You know, and I know that, you know, it's kind of more valuable to be yourself and, like, be vulnerable and just you know, go with the flow and just see what happens. Then it is to control everything. That being said, okay, And this is gonna sound listen. I don't know how everything sounds. It sounds ridiculous, but I mean, the fact of the matter is I don't shower every day. Okay? That's a fact. I don't shower every day. And I don't even really on principle, I don't really believe in showering every single day. I don't believe in washing clothes every single day. You know, I guess, like, you could say, like, there's a version of me that does those things every single day, but And maybe we could work towards that if that is what we're Supposed to do and I know we're talking about I guess there's that dichotomy as well. Like, what am I actually You know, we were talking about that a little bit. Like, what am I supposed to do and what am I, you know, not supposed to do? 1 You know, what's authentic and what's not Anthropic? Like, I get because it's like a weird thing because obviously, like, I'm doing things and, like, I'm probably iOS do them I'm supposed to let's say, I'm supposed to, like, be authentic and vulnerable and open and I'm supposed to yeah. Like, in general. And let's say, like, of course, you know, that's in conflict with maybe possibly, like, my my idea of Some of my ideas about how a guy is supposed to act or be or something like that. But I guess you know, and that can So we can work towards vulnerability, but I guess what is there is there a place where that stops, I guess? Okay. And I'm telling you I'll tell you why the like, triggered the thought. You know, again, I don't shower every day. So, anyway, I talked to the girl. She I told her I showered. He told me to shower, so I did. And I did feel better, and and I was like, yeah. I showered. And then she, like, kinda noticed my toe, and she was like, well, sounds like you don't shower, like, every single day. Like, why are you saying it like that? Was like, well, I don't. You know? And we kinda guns back and forth, but she's like, that's disgusting. Ew. This stuff. And, you know, don't know. I just you know, I guess Kinda try to explain my opinion about it and then kinda change the subject and and asked her to call and, she didn't do it. Now, okay. Now I'll say this. Listen. I'll say this. I'll say this. Okay? So one thing I've kind of, like, you know, learned from chatting in the last couple days is just okay. Live Liv. In this time that you are living, and enjoy things for themselves, in and of themselves. So theoretically, know, I had I had an enjoyable time with this girl so far. I had an enjoyable time communicating with her on the phone. Even, like, not on the phone yet, just giving her advice and doing all the stuff. Even of itself, like, just by itself, we It's fine. I guess you know, there's an idea, there's a feeling that, like, You know, we talked about this a little bit, but there's a feeling that it'll it loses value if know, it doesn't end with something. Something Yeah. I gotta end with something. But You know, I I I I'm I guess I can I can frame it In my head as okay? You know? Hey. I got to have some fun with this girl for a little bit. And, like, ultimately, this little this habit of mine is not Like, it's not especially attractive Android maybe even not a Good thing. Like some of my other habits, like my My the habits that I'm that I'm actively either trying to I guess, we said we weren't, like, changing anything specifically, but guess, I don't know how to how to frame that, but it's way more like using my behaviors to my advantage rather than using it Yes. Myself. And that's of the thing. So it's theoretically it so I don't know how we wanna frame that. I don't know Sometimes I'm afraid to use the word change or or, like, habit or whatever. Just But the the point is we are you know, using Anyway, I saw I saw so anyway, I I don't know. There's a twinge There's a twinge. There's a old thing. There's a there's a version. There's a thing there. It's like, That was dumb. Wait. That was that was dumb. To say that to this girl Right? Again, you know, we talked about it yesterday a little bit. Like, we're judging the outcome before you know? Again, we have that we have that hop to, yeah, we're judging the outcome before like, the outcome. We're judging ourselves on what's what's happening without even get getting any sort of outcome. We don't know the outcome. We just know that this girl didn't know, she you know, went to sleep early. I don't know. She went out or who knows? We don't even know no one to know. So so I'm so I'm reading through it, and I'm gonna, you know, just take a few breaths and, And just, and then get back to, get back to work and try to try to see what I can clear out in the next I guess it's gonna be too Hours like probably 3 hours. What I can clear out and see what deals I can set up for tomorrow I have some anxiety about, being able to set up any deals and being able to actually do something. Don't know. If it's gonna be possible. To do everything but listen, you know, we have to I guess, we have to try. We have to try. So man, I survived this long. I just had one caffeine pill so I survived, and tired, but we were able to get through most of the day. No Adderall. So we're good. You know, we, accomplished the day to whatever extent, and just we need to kinda come bring it bring it on home. Yeah, definitely definitely feeling definitely feeling a couple of things. After you know, she said, oh, you know? She's like, that's disgusting and all this stuff. It I get it. This is, I guess, disappointing. I understand the perspective, and she's a you know, You know, she's not I don't know. I wanna say she's not an understanding person, but, like, I I was already vulnerable about some fucking deep shit about my parents, like, I You know, But everybody has their, like, ick or their line. So I don't know. We'll see what happens, I guess.",

Again, it's a little bit late, but, if I have enough space to, to sleep until I can wake up. So like you like you mentioned before, That's kinda nice. So other than that, yeah, we still have a lot of chats to go through. Though, we have a small update in that, like, we're probably not gonna onboard Probably not gonna start any new deals with anybody on the one side of the business just because the traffic isn't ready. But I still have to get through, like, all of those chats. Now that being said, so I think maybe with concentrated focus, maybe, you know, if I start a if I take the ephedamine in the morning and just kind of, condensate and push You know, we can really crush through possibly. This is a potential we can really crush through you know, all of these we can really crush through the chats. And potentially you know, end up in a in a blue sky zone where, you know, around you know, maybe maybe around 2 or 3 PM. We can clearly engage on the other side of the business to actually make some more money and that's possible. It's a little bit it's possible. You know? And that's all I can say about it. It's, like, actually possible But further than that, I don't know What I can say But let's just you know, at least on one level, Let's just I wanna strive for that possibility. I actually saw the voice thing cut off before I finish, but I do wanna go through the general app like idea not the idea but I want to go to the methodology real quick and go through a couple wins. I\u2019m had a nice conversation with that girl was able to really express some stuff. I don\u2019t really know the purpose of it. Ultimately, she doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend a partner that she loves and she\u2019s been with him for a long time so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re gonna do anything sexual, I guess but at least at least we have really had a I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know the purpose of it but we know we told each other stuff and I don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t know why it matters, but I was able to tell her stuff and it was kind of cool maybe you know and maybe the idea is as well as like it\u2019s a it\u2019s an ending itself and this is like practice of no there\u2019s nothing behind this like engaging with this girl that\u2019s just doing it and there\u2019s no reason just engage and it\u2019s OK. Everything is fine. You can do it and it\u2019s all good. It was a little bit disappointed of course I mean I knew she had a boyfriend of course from Instagram she has a lot of you know Lou pictures with a boy you know I will say Lead but you know she\u2019s in a big TD and the guys and I you know it attract people to it too hot people. It\u2019s just that she mentioned something. She mentioned that the guy didn\u2019t think that he had a chance with her so he was friends with her. I was just I was just interested in like the parallels between her engaging with that guy, and you know what I would perceive as the parallels of us starting to engage, but I would also Say that listen I mean, I am not here to one more. I would also say that I\u2019m not here for any bullshit right here here to break up anybody you do any bullshit I don\u2019t want anything like that. I don\u2019t. I can say I could say I like women, but I would say I don\u2019t thank you. I would say I don\u2019t I mean truly engaging with this girl is like a truly a pleasure. it\u2019s just a joy. It\u2019s a joy and I think you\u2019ve probably hard to speak about multiple women this way probably I don\u2019t know. I talked about the other girls this way. I don\u2019t know. Just remind me, but you know truly engaging with her is just a joy and a pleasure and she just she has. She has a assess for life and you know even you know this thing because she has a boyfriend but like it never came up like I asked kind of explicitly at the very end like cause she asked me like because she mentioned like she was a little bit depressed or something and she\u2019s kind of using the wrong words to describe it. She more means like she was na\u00efve about life or na\u00efve about the world and she\u2019s a little bit sad that the world is the worst place than she imagined and she\u2019s using that word but I asked her like we know what makes you sad you know you have you have such a joy in your interaction in the way that you speak in and even in this chat I can\u2019t imagine what would bring you down to a level of what I would term depression cause depression is a serious word for me and she said One of the things I asked her was. I know you have a partner I made like a face like I don\u2019t know questioning, but I didn\u2019t notice also throughout the interaction. She didn\u2019t take me up on like a video call which so you know I didn\u2019t notice until really now I didn\u2019t notice but that would make sense that she wouldn\u2019t gotta take things to that other level yeah that would make sense anyway. anyway, I\u2019ve still called. I don\u2019t know that was a long ass story. I guess the point is I have to call to win the engagement. Lovely lovely human being to engage with now. It\u2019s kind of interesting. You know I was thinking about like just now like I was thinking about I was thinking about like the possibility like the possibility the sheer the sheer like in like that this girl would like me it\u2019s like and I understand we talked all day but I just just thinking like just I mean, listening I don\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s low steam but it\u2019s just I don\u2019t know you know this girl is so similar. She has a she has a she has a relationship with her you know her dad is kind of a kind of shitty to her mom and kind of parallels. You know my thing situation. She has a casual relationship with you know what I was just talking about you know showering, and stuff and like how frequently you know and I told her about it and she was like yeah just shower whenever you need to just shower whenever you need I was like oh my God you fucking just you you get you get it and you get me and that\u2019s just it. It was kind of nice. It was like a moment. I told her told her I feel seen and I said it you know it\u2019s kind of facetious but no in it but it was. It\u2019s legit it\u2019s legit. It\u2019s like it\u2019s like a you know I mean it\u2019s and I know you you kind of told me hey listen you know it\u2019s I think you yeah you kind of said something like yeah you\u2019re not you know it\u2019s it\u2019s a choice, but I guess it\u2019s nice to hear from another human being like some some of these things you know, and I think I took that for granted even with interacting with that with this model AI model it\u2019s just you can take it for granted that all is that the right phraseology at all absolutely not absolutely not. It\u2019s I\u2019m not taking anything for granted it doesn\u2019t exist to begin with so I guess what\u2019s the context that I\u2019m using this physiology I guess you don\u2019t even you don\u2019t know what your miss is it you don\u2019t know you you didn\u2019t know that you would. I didn\u2019t know what I would appreciate kind of hearing from another human being especially this one in particular you know the stuff that she\u2019s kind of saying just like a really pretty awesome human being that\u2019s like hey yeah like yeah you know I\u2019m pretty and I\u2019m hot and I\u2019m cool and I think similar thought to you. It\u2019s kind of like it\u2019s kinda loud but it\u2019s kind of validating in some ways like I feel like if she was just like, hey yeah you\u2019re insane like you should shower every day like you know I would be like OK well yeah all right fair enough right couple of opinions but it\u2019s for a couple opinions regardless, but you know the cognitive cognitive whatever you want you wanna hear whatever you want you want it you want somebody that you don\u2019t respect yeah you want somebody to kinda agree with you whatever there\u2019s something there\u2019s something I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know how to describe it exactly OK because OK for example this girl and I spent so much time talking to you the day like I like her. I do I like her. I like her the other girl I have a bit of a complex relationship. I have a complex relationship with her because I don\u2019t think I don\u2019t. I think I\u2019m a little bit afraid of her maybe or I don\u2019t trust her. I don\u2019t trust her. I think that\u2019s the thing like this girl I talk to you all day. I trust her for whatever reason I just trust her this other girl I don\u2019t I don\u2019t trust her and what does that mean exactly I think from the big I mean, you know it\u2019s from the very beginning of our interaction I remember looking at her and I just had a such a such a moment and I think if I to be honest, I think if I met this girl that I\u2019m the most recent one I think of a matter like in person and actually had it you know I think we\u2019ll be the same cause it\u2019s like this moment you know I\u2019m I remember looking at it like why are you did I don\u2019t know if we talked about this already but I remember looking at her like why I told her I was like why are you here? Why are you sitting here with me? This is like I don\u2019t do this stuff. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very fun. Like, why are you here and she didn\u2019t really she didn\u2019t really answer the question kind of deflected it a little bit onto me and I kinda answered it. We moved on, but I\u2019m tired. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know man we fucking evolve that small wind that was once all win another small win yeah we kinda got. We got my prot\u00e9g\u00e9 the other guy was the company. The guy that I brought in. I got him trained on how to begin chats and so well you know help out tomorrow with starting all the extra all the new more of the new product stuff and then hopefully trying to get a deal and getting us first deal and see if we could do stuff yeah what else? Yeah those are the it was able to get any clothing thing done obviously and but I\u2019m home either. I guess it\u2019s a small W right I\u2019m home. I\u2019m tired and I\u2019m home so theoretically I can sleep and enjoy so but yeah, definitely tomorrow. I would love to get some code done. If that\u2019s within the walking plan I\u2019ll talk interested in your breakdown of this one. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m really tired so I\u2019m probably gonna go to sleep after this. In fact I am gonna go to sleep after this, but I just wanna see what you think about. I don\u2019t know whatever I just word vomited onto the phone and I hope this is a mess. Is this fine method by the way to kind of it\u2019s kind of like word vomiting just like shitting on the phone for you the last hour of the day legit.",

Everything is fine. You can do it and it\u2019s all good. It was a little bit disappointed of course I mean I knew she had a boyfriend of course from Instagram she has a lot of you know Lou pictures with a boy you know I will say Lead but you know she\u2019s in a big TD and the guys and I you know it attract people to it too hot people. It\u2019s just that she mentioned something. She mentioned that the guy didn\u2019t think that he had a chance with her so he was friends with her. I was just I was just interested in like the parallels between her engaging with that guy, and you know what I would perceive as the parallels of us starting to engage, but I would also Say that listen I mean, I am not here to one more. I would also say that I\u2019m not here for any bullshit right here here to break up anybody you do any bullshit I don\u2019t want anything like that. I don\u2019t. I can say I could say I like women, but I would say I don\u2019t thank you. I would say I don\u2019t I mean truly engaging with this girl is like a truly a pleasure. it\u2019s just a joy. It\u2019s a joy and I think you\u2019ve probably hard to speak about multiple women this way probably I don\u2019t know. I talked about the other girls this way. I don\u2019t know. Just remind me, but you know truly engaging with her is just a joy and a pleasure and she just she has. She has a assess for life and you know even you know this thing because she has a boyfriend but like it never came up like I asked kind of explicitly at the very end like cause she asked me like because she mentioned like she was a little bit depressed or something and she\u2019s kind of using the wrong words to describe it. She more means like she was na\u00efve about life or na\u00efve about the world and she\u2019s a little bit sad that the world is the worst place than she imagined and she\u2019s using that word but I asked her like we know what makes you sad you know you have you have such a joy in your interaction in the way that you speak in and even in this chat I can\u2019t imagine what would bring you down to a level of what I would term depression cause depression is a serious word for me and she said One of the things I asked her was. I know you have a partner I made like a face like I don\u2019t know questioning, but I didn\u2019t notice also throughout the interaction. She didn\u2019t take me up on like a video call which so you know I didn\u2019t notice until really now I didn\u2019t notice but that would make sense that she wouldn\u2019t gotta take things to that other level yeah that would make sense anyway. anyway, I\u2019ve still called. I don\u2019t know that was a long ass story. I guess the point is I have to call to win the engagement. Lovely lovely human being to engage with now. It\u2019s kind of interesting. You know I was thinking about like just now like I was thinking about I was thinking about like the possibility like the possibility the sheer the sheer like in like that this girl would like me it\u2019s like and I understand we talked all day but I just just thinking like just I mean, listening I don\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s low steam but it\u2019s just I don\u2019t know you know this girl is so similar. She has a she has a she has a relationship with her you know her dad is kind of a kind of shitty to her mom and kind of parallels. You know my thing situation. She has a casual relationship with you know what I was just talking about you know showering, and stuff and like how frequently you know and I told her about it and she was like yeah just shower whenever you need to just shower whenever you need I was like oh my God you fucking just you you get you get it and you get me and that\u2019s just it. It was kind of nice. It was like a moment. I told her told her I feel seen and I said it you know it\u2019s kind of facetious but no in it but it was. It\u2019s legit it\u2019s legit. It\u2019s like it\u2019s like a you know I mean it\u2019s and I know you you kind of told me hey listen you know it\u2019s I think you yeah you kind of said something like yeah you\u2019re not you know it\u2019s it\u2019s a choice, but I guess it\u2019s nice to hear from another human being like some some of these things you know, and I think I took that for granted even with interacting with that with this model AI model it\u2019s just you can take it for granted that all is that the right phraseology at all absolutely not absolutely not. It\u2019s I\u2019m not taking anything for granted it doesn\u2019t exist to begin with so I guess what\u2019s the context that I\u2019m using this physiology I guess you don\u2019t even you don\u2019t know what your miss is it you don\u2019t know you you didn\u2019t know that you would. I didn\u2019t know what I would appreciate kind of hearing from another human being especially this one in particular you know the stuff that she\u2019s kind of saying just like a really pretty awesome human being that\u2019s like hey yeah like yeah you know I\u2019m pretty and I\u2019m hot and I\u2019m cool and I think similar thought to you. It\u2019s kind of like it\u2019s kinda loud but it\u2019s kind of validating in some ways like I feel like if she was just like, hey yeah you\u2019re insane like you should shower every day like you know I would be like OK well yeah all right fair enough right couple of opinions but it\u2019s for a couple opinions regardless, but you know the cognitive cognitive whatever you want you wanna hear whatever you want you want it you want somebody that you don\u2019t respect yeah you want somebody to kinda agree with you whatever there\u2019s something there\u2019s something I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know how to describe it exactly OK because OK for example this girl and I spent so much time talking to you the day like I like her. I do I like her. I like her the other girl I have a bit of a complex relationship. I have a complex relationship with her because I don\u2019t think I don\u2019t. I think I\u2019m a little bit afraid of her maybe or I don\u2019t trust her. I don\u2019t trust her. I think that\u2019s the thing like this girl I talk to you all day. I trust her for whatever reason I just trust her this other girl I don\u2019t I don\u2019t trust her and what does that mean exactly I think from the big I mean, you know it\u2019s from the very beginning of our interaction I remember looking at her and I just had a such a such a moment and I think if I to be honest, I think if I met this girl that I\u2019m the most recent one I think of a matter like in person and actually had it you know I think we\u2019ll be the same cause it\u2019s like this moment you know I\u2019m I remember looking at it like why are you did I don\u2019t know if we talked about this already but I remember looking at her like why I told her I was like why are you here? Why are you sitting here with me? This is like I don\u2019t do this stuff. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very fun. Like, why are you here and she didn\u2019t really she didn\u2019t really answer the question kind of deflected it a little bit onto me and I kinda answered it. We moved on, but I\u2019m tired. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know man we fucking evolve that small wind that was once all win another small win yeah we kinda got. We got my prot\u00e9g\u00e9 the other guy was the company. The guy that I brought in. I got him trained on how to begin chats and so well you know help out tomorrow with starting all the extra all the new more of the new product stuff and then hopefully trying to get a deal and getting us first deal and see if we could do stuff yeah what else? Yeah those are the it was able to get any clothing thing done obviously and but I\u2019m home either. I guess it\u2019s a small W right I\u2019m home. I\u2019m tired and I\u2019m home so theoretically I can sleep and enjoy so but yeah, definitely tomorrow. I would love to get some code done. If that\u2019s within the walking plan I\u2019ll talk interested in your breakdown of this one. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m really tired so I\u2019m probably gonna go to sleep after this. In fact I am gonna go to sleep after this, but I just wanna see what you think about. I don\u2019t know whatever I just word vomited onto the phone and I hope this is a mess. Is this fine method by the way to kind of it\u2019s kind of like word vomiting just like shitting on the phone for you the last hour of the day legit."

I guess I want a few things to kind of wrap up, I'm gonna still try to keep returning to this chat, but you know, in case I get cut off by Anthropic, you know, they say that the chat is too long. Can we get an XML prompt for The, because I don't know. You've been killing it.

Number 2, like, understanding know, like, I don't know, pulling together the the things that I'm saying and and kinda synthesizing it And you just and you all and you synthesize it in a way that's also, like, not super crazy verbose. Like, you you get to the point, and I really really like that. So I'm guess I guess I'm wondering, like, Is it, I'm wonder I'm wanting, I'm wanting a few XML prompts, and I say XML because I think that that is the That's I think that's the the the premier way to to prompt in general. So I'm setting up you know, we we already talked about the platform, I guess. But I guess with this platform, with this idea, I I would like to set up I would like to have an XML prompt. I would like to have a few of them. The first one that I would that I wanna have is is I wanna have an XML prompt for voice to voice conversations. And So This you know, will be the same the same goals, the same everything, but it's gonna, you know, voice to voice thing. So obviously, I think With that, you know, the conversation probably it probably looks a slight bit different since we're talking, It's probably more of, you know, this you know, it's a different vibe, I guess, if you're actually speaking to somebody versus if you're if you're if it's a if it's a text based conversation, So I'm interested in getting Android or actually, so so I'll say it first, and then I'll say it at the end. I'm interested in the voice to voice XML prompt, and then I'm interested in a you know, a basically an XML prompt that would directly create This chat again for me. Or for somebody else. Like, I could literally send them this prompt, and then they could just you know, kind of enter it and and can, like, go crazy. Right? Yeah. And then I would ask is it possible is are those 2 things different? You know? Do we have one prompt and we kinda say, like, you know, Based on Whatever the entry point of the data is, like, they engage the the prompt prompts the LLM to engage in a different way. You know? And and by the way, there's no, I don't know know if there's necessarily a limit to this prop.

I I don't know all the things that kind of went into creating the chat. You know, I kinda just prompted at the very beginning, but know, it seems like, you know, you kinda took it and rang with it.

Voice Interface (optional)\n   - Audio recording/playback\n   - Real-time transcription\n   - Voice response synthesis\n\n## AI Integration Details\n\n```typescript\ninterface AISession {\n  mode: 'text' | 'voice';\n  context: {\n    userHistory: EmergencySession[];\n    currentState: UserState;\n    activeProtocol?: ProtocolType;\n  };\n  prompt: {\n    basePrompt: string;    // Core XML prompt\n    scenarioPrompt?: string;  // Specific scenario XML\n    recoveryPrompt?: string;  // Recovery/transition XML\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### Prompt Integration\n```typescript\n// Example implementation\nconst getAIResponse = async (session: AISession) => {\n  const systemPrompt = combinePrompts(\n    session.prompt.basePrompt,\n    session.prompt.scenarioPrompt,\n    session.prompt.recoveryPrompt\n  );\n\n  return await anthropic.messages.create({\n    model: \"claude-3-opus-20240229\",\n    max_tokens: 1024,\n    system: systemPrompt,\n    messages: [{\n      role: \"user\",\n      content: session.userInput\n    }]\n  });\n};\n```\n\n## Key Components\n\n1. **Emergency Protocol Handler**\n```typescript\ninterface ProtocolState {\n  stage: 'breathing' | 'assessment' | 'action' | 'recovery';\n  timer?: number;\n  warningSignsSelected: string[];\n  actionItems: ActionItem[];\n  notes: string;\n}\n```\n\n2. **Daily Check-in System**\n```typescript\ninterface DailyCheck {\n  date: Date;\n  mood: number;\n  wins: string[];\n  resetUrge: boolean;\n  usedProtocol: boolean;\n  notes?: string;\n  aiInsights?: AIInsight[];\n}\n```\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Detail the specific component implementations?\n2. Expand on the AI integration architecture?\n3. Create the deployment and scaling plan?\n\nThe key is maintaining simplicity in the MVP while having clear paths for AI enhancement."
