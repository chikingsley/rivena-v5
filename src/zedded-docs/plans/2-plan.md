# Therapy AI App - Project Request (Draft 4 - MVP Focused)

## Project Description
A web application providing AI-powered therapy and mental wellbeing support targeted at young adults (35 and under), initially focusing on individuals within Christian and Mormon communities. The MVP focuses on delivering core conversational AI therapy with a rudimentary memory system to enhance personalization over time.  Key features for MVP include CBT-based conversations, AI-driven memory of key conversation themes, a simple "Memory Library" UI, and integration of a Big Five personality test via a click-through questionnaire. The app will utilize a freemium monetization model, offering a free tier with a basic AI model.  Advanced visualization, belief system integration, and full memory management features are deferred to post-MVP iterations.

## Target Audience
Young adults, aged 35 and under, seeking general mental wellbeing and personal growth support, initially focusing on individuals within Christian and Mormon communities.

## Desired Features (MVP Scope indicated)

### Core AI Therapy (MVP - IN SCOPE)
- [x] Conversational AI interaction
    - [x] Natural language understanding and generation
    - [x] Therapeutic conversation flow based on CBT principles

### Memory System (MVP - PARTIAL SCOPE)
- [x] Strategic memory storage of user details and **key conversation themes** (MVP - Simplified. Defer full stories, events, dynamics to post-MVP).
- [x] Long-term user context awareness beyond LLM context window using stored **key themes** (MVP - Simplified).
- [x] **Basic** memory retrieval and AI utilization in conversation: AI to utilize and mention key themes in conversation (MVP - Simplified).
- [x] **Rudimentary** "Memory Library" UI: Simple sidebar list of keywords/themes representing stored memories. "View" to show conversation snippet (MVP - Simplified. Defer editing/deletion to post-MVP).
    - [x] Memory retrieval using vector similarity search or similar techniques (e.g., Jina Embeddings) for **key themes** (MVP - Simplified).
    - [ ] Tracking of persons, places, and things within conversations for improved memory relevance (entity recognition) (MVP - Defer to post-MVP for full entity tracking, basic theme association in MVP).
    - [ ] User Memory Control (View, Edit, Delete) - **DEFERRED TO POST-MVP**

### Visualization & Generative UI (MVP - OUT OF SCOPE) - **DEFERRED TO POST-MVP**
- [ ] Generative UI elements
    - [ ] Visualization of memory creation and usage in the UI.
    - [ ] Visualization of user progress and issues.
    - [ ] AI-driven pattern identification and visualization.
        - [ ]  "Habit tracker" style UI elements dynamically generated by the AI to track progress on addressing identified negative patterns.
    - [ ] Mind map visualization of conversation topics and connections.
    - [ ] Visualization of "Interruptions" (user defined).

### Community & Personalization (MVP - PARTIAL SCOPE)
- [x] Personality tests integration (MVP - Big Five Questionnaire - IN SCOPE)
    - [x] Big Five personality test integration via click-through questionnaire.
    - [ ] Myers-Briggs personality test integration - **DEFERRED TO POST-MVP**
    - [x] Utilize personality test results for **basic personalization** in therapy approaches (MVP - Basic personalization, deeper personalization post-MVP).
- [ ] Personal Belief/Meaning System Integration - **DEFERRED TO POST-MVP**
- [ ] Faith-based content integration (Christian & Mormon specific texts/wisdom) - **DEFERRED TO POST-MVP (initial MVP can be secular or lightly faith-based)**
    - [ ] Balance secular CBT with faith-based perspectives, drawing on relevant texts/wisdom.
    - [ ] Prioritize user agency and CBT-based self-help over purely faith-based solutions.

## Design Requests
- [x] User-friendly and intuitive interface for therapy conversations, appealing to a younger audience (35 and under). (MVP Focus - Clean and Functional Chat UI).
    - [x] Design for **basic** visualization of memory library in sidebar (MVP - Simple list of keywords/themes).
    - [ ] Design for visualizing complex data (patterns, progress trackers, mind maps, conversational flow) - **DEFERRED TO POST-MVP**

## Other Notes
- [x] Need to consider differentiation and "moat" strategies against competitors in the AI therapy app market. Focus on memory system and personalization as key differentiators for MVP.
- [x] Explore potential of generative UI for various visualizations - **POST-MVP FOCUS**.
- [x] Data Privacy and Security are paramount: Utilize secure and potentially HIPAA-compliant storage (user indicated intent), consider data encryption and anonymization where possible, and be mindful of relevant data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.). User account deletion must be supported.
- [x] Monetization Strategy: Freemium model, offering free access with a basic AI model (e.g., Mistral) and potential paid tiers for more advanced models - MVP focuses on free tier functionality.
- [x] Technical Challenge: Robust and scalable memory system (even simplified theme-based in MVP) with vector similarity search is a significant technical undertaking. Consider Prisma/Supabase/Jina as potential starting tech, but ongoing R&D and optimization may be necessary.
- [x] MVP Scope Prioritization: MVP is focused on core AI Therapy conversation, rudimentary memory system (theme-based), basic "Memory Library" UI, and Big Five personality test via questionnaire to validate core value proposition and get user feedback quickly.  Advanced features are strategically deferred to post-MVP iterations to manage development effort and risk.
