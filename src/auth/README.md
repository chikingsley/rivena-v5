# Better Auth Implementation Checklist

## Authentication Architecture

The authentication system is built using the following components:

1. **Core Configuration** (`src/auth/server/auth.ts`): Defines the main Better Auth setup including database adapter and authentication methods.

2. **Auth Handler** (`src/auth/server/route.ts`): Provides a bridge between Better Auth and Bun's server routes, handling request format conversions.

3. **Custom Actions** (`src/auth/server/actions.ts`): Implements extended authentication functionality with custom validation and business logic.

4. **Server Integration** (`src/server.ts`): Connects all components, exposing authentication endpoints and protecting routes that require authentication.

5. **Client Utilities** (`src/auth/client/auth-client.ts`): Provides React hooks and utilities for authenticating from the frontend.

6. **UI Components** (`src/auth/components/`): Contains authentication-related components like login forms and registration forms.

## 1. Initial Setup

- [x] Install Better Auth packages
  ```bash
  bun add better-auth
  bun add better-auth/react  # For client components
  ```

- [x] Install necessary adapters
  ```bash
  bun add better-auth/adapters/prisma  # If using Prisma
  ```

- [x] Create directory structure
  ```bash
  mkdir -p src/auth/server
  mkdir -p src/auth/client
  mkdir -p src/auth/components
  mkdir -p src/auth/hooks
  mkdir -p src/auth/types
  ```

## 2. Server-Side Configuration

  - [x] Add error logging

- [x] Add toast notifications for auth events
  - [x] Success messages
  - [x] Error messages

## 8. Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for auth logic

  - [ ] Test protected routes
  - [ ] Test authentication flow

## 9. Bun-Specific Optimizations

- [x] Optimize Better Auth for Bun
  - [ ] Use Bun's faster crypto implementations if available
  - [x] Configure Bun-specific environment variables (src/auth/bun-cors.ts)

- [x] Create error handling for Bun-specific issues
  - [x] Add fallbacks for potential compatibility issues

## 10. Documentation

- [x] Document authentication implementation
  - [x] Create README with setup instructions
  - [x] Document API endpoints
  - [x] Add comments to code

## 11. Security Review

- [ ] Review authentication flow
  - [ ] Check for security vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Ensure proper CSRF protection
  - [ ] Verify password policies

- [ ] Implement rate limiting
  - [ ] Add protection against brute force attacks

## 12. Deployment

- [ ] Configure environment variables for production
  - [ ] Set up auth URLs
  - [ ] Configure secrets

- [ ] Test authentication in staging environment
  - [ ] Verify all auth flows work in production-like setting

## API Endpoints

### Standard Better Auth Endpoints

- `POST /api/auth/sign-up/email`: Register a new user with email/password
- `POST /api/auth/sign-in/email`: Log in with email/password
- `GET /api/auth/sign-out`: Log out the current user
- `GET /api/auth/session`: Get the current session data

### Custom Endpoints

- `POST /api/custom-auth/register`: Register with additional validation
- `POST /api/custom-auth/login`: Login with additional logging
- `POST /api/custom-auth/logout`: Logout with session cleanup

## Next Steps

1. ~~Complete the AuthProvider component to handle protected routes~~ ✅
2. ~~Implement form submission logic in login and register forms~~ ✅
3. ~~Add validation and error handling to forms~~ ✅
4. Create a profile page for users to manage their accounts
5. Set up role-based access control (if needed)
6. Implement unit and integration tests for authentication flows
